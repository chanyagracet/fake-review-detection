# Data Description

### How to load the data
Our dataset is relatively large so we have compiled them inside `data.tar.gz`. Once you download and unzip all the files, the data should be divided into the train, dev, and test subsets that were used for this project.

### Data Collection & Generation

The fake review dataset contains 40,000 entries:

- **20,000 authentic (OR) reviews**: Human-written from the Amazon Reviews dataset.
- **20,000 fake (CG) reviews**: Generated using the GPT-2 language model, fine-tuned on Amazonâ€™s review data.

For the generated reviews, the creators used stratified sampling across the Top-10 Amazon product categories, balancing various review lengths to align with the original data distribution.

We used an 80/10/10 training/development/testing split to partition the data.

### Data Fields

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **category**: Product category identifier (e.g., `Home_and_Kitchen_5`).
- **rating**: Product rating, from 1 to 5.
- **label**: Review type - "OR" for Original and "CG" for Computer-Generated.
- **text\_**: Full text of the review.

### Example Data

| ------------------ | ------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Home_and_Kitchen_5 | 5.0    | CG    | Love this! Well made, sturdy, and very comfortable. I love it! Very pretty. |
| Books_5            | 4.0    | OR    | Good story. Good book. Jennifer Ryan consistently writes great books.       |
