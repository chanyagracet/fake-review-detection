# Description of `code`
This `code` subdirectory contains two files: `cis5300_final_project.ipynb` and `cis5300_final_project.py`. We have written our code in such a way that the models and evaluations are all down in the same file.

To get the best results and visualizations, we recommend that you download the .ipynb notebook and run all the cells. Make sure to first go to `/data/` folder and download all the data needed for the project. Mount that data into your google drive to make sure it can be found by the collab notebook.

Once everything is ran, there will also be a section for you to run and download all the outputs at the end (to your drive as well).

If you want to run the Python file instead, clone the repo, upload the data to the necessary directories, change the code from mounting/parsing Drive to parsing your local directory, and run `python3 cis5300_final_project.py` in the directory. Note, that we have only configured the code to work with getting files from Google Drive, so using the .py file will require additional file configuration.
