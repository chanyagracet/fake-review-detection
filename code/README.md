# Description of `code`
This `code` subdirectory contains three files: `cis5300_final_project.ipynb`, `cis5300_final_project.py`, and `simple_majority_baseline.py`. We have written our code in such a way that the models and evaluations are all in the same file.

## Running Strong Baseline and Extensions
To get the best results and visualizations for the strong baselines and extensions, we recommend that you download the .ipynb notebook and run all the cells. Firstly, make sure to  go to `/data/` folder and download all the data needed for the project. Upload that data into your Google Drive (My Drive) to make sure it can be found by the collab notebook once it is mounted to your drive.

Once everything is run, there will also be a section for you to run and download all the outputs at the end.

If you want to run the Python file instead, clone the repo, upload the data to the necessary directories, change the code from mounting/parsing Drive to parsing your local directory, and run `python3 cis5300_final_project.py` in the directory. Note, that we have only configured the code to work with getting files from Google Drive, so using the .py file will require additional file configuration.

## Running Simple Baseline

Run `python3 simple_majority_baseline.py`.
