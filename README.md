# fake-review-detection
This is the GitHub repository for our data, code, and output for NLP models that we built to classify fake Amazon reviews.

## Motivation
We are 5 out of the 310 million users on Amazon. Ever since the pandemic, e-commerce has been growing significantly, gaining traction over brick and mortar and retail stores. Given the benefits of being able to conveniently browse through products and prices and the convenience of fast deliveries; online stores such as Amazon have gained million of users.

One of the main disadvantage of online shopping is being unable to touch, see, or try on the products in real life. As a result, buyers have been relying on reviews from other buyers to make their purchasing decision. With the recent rise of LLM and AI tools that can mimick humans, we want to create models that can analyze and classify whether a review is computer-generated or not.

Overall, we hope to be able to help users better understand products and improve the trustworthiness of these reviews by building models that can detect machine-generated ones.

## Objective

Our term project aims to create a model that can detect and analyze patterns that distinguish genuine, human-written Amazon reviews from fake, computer-generated ones.

Using a fake review dataset from Amazon, we build models from simple baseline that has 95% accuracy on detecting these fake reviews.
