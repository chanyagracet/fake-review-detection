"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was really well paced, and the characters were great.
I loved that all of them had doubts, they sounded real. They felt lust, love, jelousy and all the things you feel when you are in love.
Another thing I adored: they are not ""perfect"".... they are very ""human""!
I also have a lot of fun with the side characters, and Iam crossing fingers to get their stories!
Iam so happy with this one...because I found Lane Hart this year, and she rocked my world with the ""Cocky Cage Fighter series"" And now this series is having the same effect! YAY!
I strongly recommend this one!",1,1,0.8249947571716805
"No General ever won a war by dying for his country, he won it by making his enemies die and then coming home to die a few months later in a car crash. Sadly that was the fate of the real general Patton. The movie is a first rate film about one of America's most controversial Generals. I can't say I liked everything Patton did, but he was living in a world wide inferno of a hell on earth so I think he did better than most would have in his position. Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay for Patton and I was deeply impressed by the style. It captured the general's character extremely well. The acting of George C. Scott was above reproach. The blu-ray edition was high definition awesomeness. All in all it was a terrific film and a worthy addition to any avid film buffs collection, ""ahem"".",1,1,0.9280003582399093

"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people.",1,1,0.9487838312491425

"Received this book as ARC from NetGalley for review.
Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor #2).
The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1).

A great addition to Debbie Macomber's easy reading novels about family and friendships in a small town.
This new addition is a spin-off of sorts from her hugely popular Cedar Cove series which is now televised on Hallmark Channel. The characters at Rose Harbor are as friendly and hospitable as their neighbors in Cedar Cove. The setting revolves around a newly widowed woman who pours all her energy into the Inn which she was supposed to run with her husband. The interesting characters who come by for a visit are sure to delight.

In the second book, Jo Marie continues putting the final touches on the Inn with help from a handyman who doesn't like to talk about himself much. Although she finds him incorrigible at times, they seem to enjoy each other's company. A friendship appears to be in bloom at Rose Harbor Inn.",1,1,0.9842809454955121

"I read this book as a teen-ager and was constantly putting it down because it was making me so nervous. I saw even then, at a young age, how possible it was for this world to become a reality. How many people try to lose themselves in drugs, alcohol, meaningless TV? We are closer to this Brave New World than we like to admit. Can this insanity our world is headed toward be stopped? I don't know but I fear that Huxley understood the human conditon all too well. We believe everything we hear on TV or read in the newspapers. Too many of us have left our intelligence and perception at the door. Wake up before it is too late and think for yourself. There was a version of Brave New World with Leonard Nimoy which presented a sort of happy ending for two people, which did not occur in the book but still leaves the Brave New World untouched. I won't say too much about John ""the Savage"" who was more human than the rest of the population but he is the mirror Huxley uses to show us how barren and sterile this Brave New World is. A place where every word can be uttered except mother and father. Children are born in laboratories. The family unit has been disassembled with all loyalty going to the state. As frightening as it is, it a must read for those who want to understand what is happening now and how easily it can happen. The question becomes: do we rule technology or do we allow it to rule us?",1,1,0.9854266216307352

"We've all seen it...the mess in the trunk or under the seat.  For some reason wires just naturally find their way into nots, and having big heavy cable clamps on the ends doesn't help matters much.  Add to that the fact that your car won't start and your mood is deteriorating fast!  It's a recipe for disaster!  Well no longer!  Some finally invented something to save us from our frustrations.  The Arsenal cable organizer.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

Update: I just bought a second bag and a set of Coleman 25' 2ga cables.  They fit great!  So buy this bag with confidence for just about any cable size and length combo you can find!!!",1,1,0.9940412633802073

"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!

"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.

"I just moved to a new city and was constantly getting lost so I wanted to buy an easy-to-use GPS unit.  I've never owned a GPS before so I can't compare this product to others, but I was able to make good use of this unit within minutes of taking it out of the box.  The touch display and menu navigation are quite user friendly.  It took me a while to figure out the best settings, though. One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.  I find that more useful than displaying the time to my destination, which in my experience the device consistently underestimates.  Also not sure why they bothered to have the device tell you your speed, since cars already have speedometers.  Still, a very handy device that I now find almost indispensable.",1,1,0.9666601943399399

"I have had this keyboard for a year. I bought it because it is light and thin.  It succeeds in both those areas. The protruding hinge doesn't really bother me although it is not elegant.  The rest of the keboard actually is kind of cool.  I like the tilting mechanism when it is open. Some complain that the ipad falls out of the keyboard slot. It does occasionally but it works pretty well in general.  Now for the negative...and it has become big enough for me that I can't recommend the device.  The ipad and keyboard, when in the closed position, does not clasp shut.  The ipad rests in the closed position on top of the keyboard.  It easily slides off, but more often, it moves just enough to turn the ipad on and wear down the battery.  At least once or twice a week, I go to use it and it is dead because it just sat on for 12 hours. You can't see that it is turned on.  It is so frustrating. I don't know why they didn't make a clasp or connector to keep the thing closed.  Normal travel is bound to jar it open just enought to turn it on. Ugh.  If you can manage keeping it closed (or completely turn off the ipad each time) the keyboard works well.  Thats it.",1,1,0.9519433105608999

Most dough would stick to it if you do not use flour (good for some doughs).  Also, it's slightly non-stick nature means you do not have to use too much flour for rolling.

"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size.",1,1,0.9716916181677354

"This was my third novel by author Lorraine Carey. I was expecting that same Classic Style of adventure, but in Out of the Ashes I found Carey had exhibited her ability to add a twist on that old Classic style using rich Native American legends with the paranormal. Dean Banks is a teen who lives out west and is not your normal teen . He inherits the ability to have superhuman powers from an ancient Apache shaman as he alone must destroy it before it destroys a centuries old gold mine. I loved how his bravery and strong sense of spirituality were brought out in this novel. There is a touch of soft romance here that will warm your heart.. I think this is bound to be the best seller for young adults.

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work.

"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish.

"Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems.",1,1,0.9624486436016253

And one of my plants got sucked into the filter and clogged it (outtake was low flow), and the extra filter pads that came with were TOO BIG for the filter (I cut them to size).

"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.

The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?

Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end. My pulse quickly dropped after first 20 pages. My hair never raised and as I was reading the climax scene there was no earth movement.

I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.

I had to use a cotton pad to get out the holes, and it's just a matter of removing the pad once a week.

"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from.

"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

This is a standalone novel, and one of the better ones I've read in a while. Don't expect any kind of major angst here. It's just a sweet story of two people rediscovering the passion they once had for each other.",1,1,0.9266256605829477

"This is a great courtroom drama, with detailed analysis of the characters involved. No character is a stereotype, with some approaching pure evil and others somewhat good, but all the characters are believable and their behavior consistent. Turk is very adept at providing just the right level of detail to convey his message. The story and its ending are groaningly realistic. The good guys don't always win, and evil sometimes prevails. Perverted and unusual sex are on display, but not graphic. The message is delivered in good taste, but still delivered. The courtroom action itself is spell-binding, and makes it impossible to break from reading. Give this book a read, you won't be disappointed.",1,1,0.9570360323126682

"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess.",1,1,0.9915817532702991

"Well, first off, I unfortunately didn't realize that this was more a novella, at just 95 pages rather than a novel, and with a title like 'Frenemies', I expected something perhaps a little more intense going on between our H/h, but other than some witty sparring and a bit of sarcasm, things were pretty tame, in my opinion.
That is not to say I didn't enjoy the story. Until I realized that the story was actually shorter than I thought, I couldn't put the book down, but I finally did because it was the early morning hours and I knew I could finish it off in the morning.

"I had to buy this pepper mill after reading the glowing reviews. There is just one problem with this pepper mill. It does a very poor job of grinding pepper. After grinding for several minutes, only a dusting of pepper is delivered. I have it set on 2 as I prefer a finer grind. My experience is nothing like the reviews.

"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended.",1,1,0.9916435476388722

"This is the best invention ever!  I was always afraid of pressure cookers because of the noises that came from the ones used by my parents when I was a kid. I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking for a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.  Curious, I purchased this one and now I'm hooked.  There are 4 appliances in my kitchen that I cannot live without: my Zojirushi rice cooker, Nuwave oven, Nutribullet, and my Instant Pot!  If any one of these wore out I'd just turn around and immediately order another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.

"Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.",1,1,0.8514342380707732

"This book had captured my attention as I had read one of her books from her series Love's Great Adventure and what appealed most was that this book was to be set in New Zealand and since I am from New Zealand, I enjoy books set here. The book starts over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She moves to Auckland where she has an IT job and moves next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book goes along we read as Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the language as being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do things here and our language. The author used phrases like Kia Ora as hello since the character next door was Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writers to grasp the different cultural differences and language. Overall though it was only tiny things that unless you are from New Zealand, you wouldn't notice or pick up.

"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT!

Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat.

"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains.",1,1,0.9603385524613465

Glocks = Do not have safeties.  Contrary to what you think.

Ford S10 = Umm, it was Chevrolet, not ford that made this little pickup. Ford makes the Ranger.

Stock = Rifles have stocks, Handguns have grips.

Clip = Hanguns have Magazines, a couple of models of extremely old rifles used a clip, which has an entirely different design.

Steel-Plated Revolver = Umm. What is this?  What is the steel plating? more steel? is the core lead?  Gimme a break.

These are just a few of the glaring errors with both of these authors.  They are playing in a sandbox where they know nothing, but at least they know nothing with consistency because these errors pop-up repeatedly.  Over and Over again.

I really despise lazy authors who do not at least do some research before they begin writing about something they know nothing about.  Quality material requires research guys, and this is not quality material.  There's a reason why some authors are constantly on the best seller lists, and some aren't, and this is why.

You also get a link to an e-book that gives you ideas of how to use the product - which is a nice bonus. I was actually thinking the poles snapped into the holder but they do not. I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts.

The relationship of PJ (the heroine), and Cole(the hero) in the earlier books was one of the same bantering which occurs among all the other KGI operatives, so it strains the credulity when Shades of Gray begins with Cole inexplicably flying to PJ's home town, and then they jump into bed by page 10 or 11!!!  As KGI teammates, they have always cared about each other, so why, when these two otherwise likeable leading characters make love, was it necessary for Maya Banks to write that they each called their physical loving by the ""F"" word??

"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

He appeared in '55 with the superior Monroe in another FOX feature, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH]]  (&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/6302484405/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B000JF5TXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>).

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

I found that it was important to read every word, because if I read to quickly and skipped over words and sometimes sentences, I missed important moments in the book.

"Aurora Rose Reynolds took possessive to a whole new level with Justified and I LOVED every single second of it. Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too!

"I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

"""Andi Under Pressure"" by Amanda Flower, is a great mystery novel for kids, based on cute, realistic characters and an intriguing plot.  Twelve-year-old Andi Boggs and her friend Colin are thrilled to be attending a prestigious science camp at a university in Kildeer, Ohio.  But from day one, the camp is plagued with a series of pranks which slowly escalate to the point of being dangerous.  Andi and Colin, being extremely curious and fairly fearless, decide to put their investigative prowess to good use, and in true Nancy Drew-esque fashion, they get themselves into pickles and seemingly impossible situations pretty often.
I would recommend this book to anybody who has kids who enjoy a good mystery novel.  The plot is interesting and draws the reader in right away. (I read the whole thing on a 3 hour flight this past weekend). The characters have good hearts and positive goals and the book is clean and safe for young readers.  Lessons about integrity and honesty are sprinkled throughout the story but they are underlying themes more than overt lessons.  In addition to the mystery, there are good moments of both humor and drama, creating a very well rounded reading experience for any kid.  This was my first Amanda Flower book and I would definitely be eager to read more of her work.

"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone.
Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome.
The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo.
The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive.

"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed.",1,1,0.9935472351703676

"I used this to tap a custom wooden live center for my Jet 1642 lathe. It's just the right thread size for the threads on the stock live center, once you remove the cone. So I made something out of maple, drilled a 5/8"" hole in it, and tapped it with this. Then I poured in a bit of thin CA glue to strengthen the wooden threads and screwed the tap in one more time to cut the threads perfectly. Now I have a wooden live center to hold the back of bowls without piercing them. This tap was indispensable for that.",1,1,0.9058125390966196

"Acorn Media has provided the DVD with english subtitles which are helpful not only to people who have hearing impediments but to foreigners (specially when politician explain very quickly intricate schemes, with names of men we know nothing about). The story is very interesting from an historical point of view. It begins with Napoleon III being dismissed and ends some times after the Second World War is over. Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fights against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every days life is a sort of thrilling gambling. For instance, he resigns his charge, thinking the government will become aware it can't do without him; in case it doesn't  Randolph will found a new Tory group, modern, kenner on social issues, and overcome the old Tory party. We see how times are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper classes are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, goes to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other women of her time. With such  ""political beasts"" as his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) was so outstanding a stateman. Love stories don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic events occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minutes were hardly enough.",1,1,0.9941598367049388
"I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Conclusion

Overall, Before He Was Famous was a great book about friends to lovers with a dash of famous musician: the perfect recipe for a great book.",1,1,0.9214559361946089
"Great theory, but poor construction.  It broke on day two after around 10 total minutes of use.  Two faults:  Poor gluing of the magnets under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pins up.  I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnets from rising fully to the top.  I reglued it and another one that was loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of its socket), and then added 2 drops of super glue to the sides of the others as well.  Problem #1 solved.  Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dots on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it.  The bumps obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim.  The veneer must be very thin.  There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnets from pushing the wood up.  OR, a ""stop"" installed in the plastic mechanism to prevent the magnet plate from rising any higher then the floor bottom, as without one the spring pressure bangs the magnets up slightly into the wood.  Still working on this problem.  Very disappointed.",1,1,0.991867122487798

"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book",1,1,0.9715980600450561

When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

***One thing that did bother me a bit, you can definitely tell the author isn't American as there were quite a few words and phrases that didn't make sense for a story that was taking place in the US. It didn't really detract from the story but did throw me for a loop.",1,1,0.9805044574491524

"Well, I am a big fan of the wide-angle lenses.  These have a wide angle view and are not the best for most situations.  The plastic body makes it difficult to slip it in and out of the lens without damaging it.  This lens is excellent for those situations.  The 2.5x zoom is also fantastic.  The auto focus is so fast that it is very easy to pull off a few items and still get the focus down.  The zoom is also very good, although I have noticed that the zoom range is not as good as I hoped.  I am really impressed with this lens and recommend it to others.This is a very good sound system. I have been using it for about 3 years and I can tell you that it works perfectly. My only gripe is the battery life is not as good as my other speaker system. I have a Samsung phone that I have been using for about a month now and I can tell you that the battery life is just not as good as my system.

"I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

"Chasing Lilacs is an impressive debut novel for author Carla Stewart. The author takes us back to 1958 and puts us in a small Texas community, and into the mind and heart of Sammie Tucker, an almost thirteen-year-old girl.

Life isn't as simple as you think it must have been ""back then."" Sammie's mother suffers with mental issues, and when she commits suicide, Sammie's world is filled with loss and confusion. Then her disgruntled aunt shows up to help ""care"" for Sammie, and things get even messier. It's a good thing that Sammie has a loving father - not to mention other townspeople who look out for her. There's her outspoken best friend, a new boy who comes to live with his uncle, and her mentors - the woman next door who raises birds, and an elderly widower who has his own secrets.

Although Sammie is a young teen, I became totally involved with the character. This story pulled me in emotionally, while it also provided surprising plot twists. I was whisked into nostalgia and a time when life was perhaps a bit slower, but the pace of the story kept me turning the pages.

Chasing Lilacs touches on the subject of mental illness and shock treatments. Not necessarily a happy topic. But is also an uplifting story of hope and forgiveness. It reminds us that even when we don't initially see it - God is still in control and working on our behalf.

I'm looking forward to reading Carla Stewart's next release.",1,1,0.9124906444034953

"I purchased this watch for my wife almost two years ago. She wore it very rarely, as a ""vacation watch"" when we went on vacations where we would be swimming or snorkeling. The watch's description on Amazon states: ""Water resistant to 100m (330ft): in general, suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but not diving."" On the second day of our most recent trip the watch stopped working, apparently due to water that had entered the display. My strong advice is to not purchase this watch if you plan to use it while snorkeling. Doing some additional research, I discovered that to really be considered adequate for snorkeling, a watch should be rated to 200 M /  20 ATM. Watches, like this Timex, rated to 100 M /  10 ATM should be OK for light swimming, but not for snorkeling. Whatever we decide on as a replacement will be rated for 200 M / 20 ATM.

"I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.

Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper.

"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.",1,1,0.8860119399458712

"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.
While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.
Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson. There is even an appearance by Ray Collins as Homer's deceased father.
While this film is not exactly what I'd call electrifying, it celebrates life and the human ability to persevere regardless of the circumstances. The remastered copy is easier on the eyes.",1,1,0.9817490848794379

"This is a very good book that deals with problems a lot of kids have, such as being picked on and left out, even if the main focus was fantasy.  Being an avid reader of fantasy, I have read all the old cleshaes, but this book was in a league all it's own.  The story is about thirteen year old Nita, who goes into a library to hide from bullies, and comes across a training book on  how to be a wizard.  After reading through it, she discovers that she has many of the qualifications, so she decides to give it a shot, though she suspects some sort of prank.  In her exploriations, she meets up with Kit, a twelve year old boy in basicly the same situation as her, and they decide to team up and  be partner wizards.  As I read this book, I found myself likeing it more and more, as I enjoyed the sense of magic, and identified  strongly with the main character.  Though some of the magic spells they were doing got a little bit tedious, the book was generaly very exiting and well written with somewhat of a sad ending.",1,1,0.9453296799263272

"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.",1,1,0.9905532645537698

"This was a good story and I really liked the characters but this read more like a really long Prologue rather than an actual full book. The chapters seemed to break in random places as if someone just counted every so many pages and placed a chapter there. There wasn't really a concrete story being told. It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail. I actually really liked that about the book but it had no real ending to it. I looked up what the series is about and it seems that this is a lead in for the 2nd book. I don't know if I liked it enough to buy the rest of the series. I did enjoy it and it has a unique group of characters, rather than the young sexy hearth throb the hero is actually an older  widower in his 50's with adult children and the heroine is a widowed woman in her 30's. I feel like this book is still a little on the premature side. I can't put my finger on it but the book felt lacking to me. I didn't fully understand the characters and their thoughts and feelings. I felt a little disconnected from where they were all coming from. Also the romance seemed rushed in the end and went from no love to instantly in love very quickly with no real lead in or gradual build up.

"I loved this Jack Hill film from 1975.

The one gang called The Silver Daggers  reminded me of a greaser stlye gang with the leather jackets and switch blade knives,also complete with a girl that has an eye patch(she lost an eye in a fight of course).Really just over the top and unrealistic but so much fun with action and dialouge that seemed to come off of the pages of a comic book. The Dagger Debs(the gangs girlfriends) kick the guys out of their own gang the Silver Daggers(they think maybe these guys are too soft) after their leader gets knocked off in a roller rink shootout. Then the girls change their gangs name to the Jezebells and go out to seek revenge for their dead leader and go up agaisnt their rival .There happens to be a rift among the Jezebell girls as there might be a traitor or traitors within their she gang.

"Troy is a Chicago cop who has been with the FBI for a long time. She's just starting to get into the detective business, and she is running out of ideas. She's been with the FBI since she was a teenager, and she's learned how to handle the FBI. She's a woman who's lost the most of her self-confidence and self-esteem. She's a very smart, independent woman, and she's on a mission to find the killer. She's determined to find him, and the only way she knows how is to go undercover.

I enjoyed the book and the characters, and I was a little confused at first. It took awhile for me to get used to the whole mystery.

"The subject is the so-called Judgment of Paris--the blind tasting in which California wines defeated French wines and shocked the world.  The film tells part of the story: the efforts of the individual--Steve Spurrier--who mounted the event and the Barrett family in Calistoga, the proprietors of Chateau Montelena.  To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.

Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition.  Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.

Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically.  The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.

The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations.  All in all, this is a nice film.  I also recommend the often-overlooked film, Year of the Comet, for wine lovers.",1,1,0.9154811457598901

"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.",1,1,0.9488851210714523

"This ball is great, our Catahoula Heeler, Rambo, loves to play with Timmy (we named the ball this when Rambo shoved it into the well ).  The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside.

"I was gifted an ARC of this boxset from Tasha Black,
also ARC of ""An Impossible Gift"" from Cristina Rayne,
as well as an ARC of ""Wish upon a star"" from Elsa Jade, in exchange for an honest review.

I'm loving this boxset so far, it has some authors I already follow & some new authors being introduced to me. Once I have read a book within, I'll add my reveiw for it.

The Clockwork Dragon by Tasha Black....
I FLOVE Tasha's ""Curse of the Alpha"" & ""Fate of the Alpha"" series & to learn that 'The Clockwork Dragon' is set at Tarker's Hollow.... made me do the happy dance. I was instantly sucked back into the lives of the citizens of Tarkers Hollow & I LOVED it!! Although it's centered around the Magical side of the community of Tarker's Hollow & not the wolves, you still get a scense of being there again. I was LOST in this, the story was rivetting.

An Impossible Gift by Cristina Rayne....
Oh My Goodness! That was short, fast paced & downright AWESOME! This is the first time I've read about Vamps from Cristina, usually it's shifters, but damn this story was good. Fast paced, full of action, loads of background story (you need this, believe me), a hot sexy Vamp who doesn't sparkle, all wrapped into a story about healing.

Wish upon a Star by Elsa Jade....
I am currently HOOKED on Elsa's ""Wolves of Angels Rest"" series, the minute one arrives on my kindle app, I'm devouring it quickly. 'Wish upon a Star' is a part of this series & what a Christmas story it was. It had me gripped from the very start, til the end... & just like the rest of the series, I devoured it & I wanted it to be longer.",1,1,0.9690095317648524

The way Leslie sets up his night of murder is worth the price of admission and it explains almost every horror movie that has a group of people in a place where they will be killed off one by one. There is some humor in it and its a dark comedy that Im glad I didn't totally give up on.,1,1,0.9615397118814069

"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?

One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.

This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!

The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining.",1,1,0.9743795733825167

"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right.",1,1,0.9662401358699867

"If you have young WWE fans in your house (I kind of hope you don't, because that stuff is not well-suited to viewing for children!), they will probably enjoy playing with something like this. The recommended age for this toy is 6+, and I'd say that is probably about right. Many 6-year-olds will be able to assemble this toy, though some will struggle with it. Unless you want to assemble it yourself and keep repairing it yourself, you had better not give this to any kid younger than 6 years old.

This set CAN be assembled in many different configurations, and that will give it a bit more longevity in the life of its play. The biggest drawback to this toy is that it doesn't come with a single WWE action figure. It would take two to make it a ""complete"" toy, yet it doesn't even come with one. To me, that's just absurd. Every playset needs to come with one or more figures to populate it, and when I see manufacturers pumping out stuff like this that forces parents to purchase more stuff to even make it fun, it really grinds my gears. The action figures that are made for this playset run $20 each, so you can plan on spending an additional $40 on top of the cost of this set to even make it ""playable."" That makes it a $90 investment for a simple toy that will - in all likelihood - not be a great time consumer for your kids. Ridiculous! There are many better products for you to invest in that will produce longer play time and better stimulation of the imagination than this toy. Skip this one!

"From the very beginning of this series, I knew that Gretchen de la O had given us a gem. What I hadn't expected was the respectful, slow and magical transition from YA to more Adult. You literally feel like you are growing up with Wilson Mooney, our heroine of the series.

In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.

However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.

I did not feel the need to go back and reread the first book to find out what I missed.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I was left wanting more about the characters.  I felt like the story was rushed and just didn't flow well.  It is definitely a book that you should read.

I did not like the cover for this book.  The cover looks like it would be used to cover the main characters.  I wish the cover had been done in a different style.  There were a few typos, but not enough to detract from the",0,0,0.0621091988688907

"I have two (2) of these. The first one is a full size USB 2.0 hub. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, but if you don't mind having to go through a couple of steps to get it on, it's very compact.

"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry.",1,1,0.9685160836774108

Ramsey has lost his family to a horrible accident and wishes he would have died with them.  Vessa has just found out her husband not only cheated again, but has been doing it since they got married and now he has some young woman pregnant.  After losing her temper for the last time, she withdrawals their money from the bank and moves it to another bank before heading to her aunt's house.  On the way she encounters a tractor trailer on its side and a collision follows.  When Ramsey gets called to the accident that mirrors the one that took his family he isn't sure he can handle it!

The outside is a lycra-type material, making the weights comfortable against the skin.  They stay on well--I use them for ankles--but are easy to get on and off.

The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives.

Review for/Author: Eva Gordon
Book title: Alpha Wolfs Pet 2, Kept
Page length: 171
Price at time: $2.99
Review:  I was first introduced to Eva Gordons work through her first book in this series, Alpha Wolfs Pet book 1, hidden. I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)

Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?

Spoons rest on the dish and stand very balanced. The dishes have good depth and good size to hold the drippings. Dishes are also good quality and wash well in the dishwasher. I use these with my white/light colored serving and plates. Like it so much that I ordered another set for the kitchen counter.

I also own stainless spoon dish/stand set for over 10 years without any rust. That's one thing I can not yet rate because I haven't owned these long enough to know if they will rust or not. But I can tell the plate on this stand is not as good as my old stainless set. So I don't wash the stand in the dishwasher, and I don't soak the stand.

"I needed this tape for the stairs up to the front door. Being in the great Northwest, we get a LOT of rain which makes wooden stairs basically a death trap. In comes traction tape, a great alternative to painting sand onto the steps (which I planned on doing until I saw this tape). I applied these during the fall when the wood wasn't dry after three days of sun... But I wanted it applied before the season's got worse. After the first day of rain, these did come up a bit, but general suction kept them applied to the board. I am sure if the wood wasn't damp when I applied them intially, there would be no problem of them moving around now. I am still very satisfied and pre-bought a second roll to apply appropriately. I also wanted to mention that this company gives great advise for applying this tape that came in quite handy.",1,1,0.9844416896004816

"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible.

"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

Let me just say that I wish he did not break my old Craftsman saw, because it had a straighter cut then the Rigid. I gave up on it, I have tried everything to adjust this saw right with zero luck. My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage.

She faces two big obstacles...Adam is a genius, but socially awkward and she can't tell him she has been hired to help him.

"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled.

"Joyce's ""Dubliners"" is a collection of fifteen short stories that present snapshots of the lives of common people in  Dublin around the beginning of the 20th Century.  The stories are subtle commentaries about  Irish attitudes towards nationalism, religion, morality, life, and death.  Each explores a distinctive, dramatic theme, such as sexual perversion  (""An Encounter""), infatuation (""Araby""), the  frustration of personal unfulfillment (""A Little Cloud"" and  ""Counterparts""), self-imposed loneliness (""A Painful  Case""), hubris (""A Mother""), and Catholic/Protestant  conflict (""Grace"").  Overtones of Irish nationalism, remembrance,  and piety permeate all the stories.
The stories are neither  depressing nor uplifting, but rather  open-ended in their denouement; no  conflicts are resolved and no moral conclusions are reached.  Joyce depicts  the characters and scenes so sympathetically that the reader understands  clearly why the dejected boy in ""Araby"" leaves the bazaar feeling  like  ""a creature driven and derided by vanity"" and the events  that drive Farrington to beat his young son at the end of  ""Counterparts.""  And why, in ""The Dead,"" Gabriel, after  giving a dinner speech in which he makes respectful reference to the dead,  feels his dignity knocked down a notch when his wife reveals to him the  tragic fate of her past love.
After nearly a century,  ""Dubliners"" remains one of the best  crystallizations of humanity  bestowed upon the world.",1,1,0.9836391845800619

"I LOVE that they sealed the bottom of this warmer! My last one was a gift and it lasted nearly 5 years... but the mice like to get in under the heater in winter (no duh, right?) and this fall, when I went to plug it in, the wires had been chewed. The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

"""Laurel Canyon"" is an entrancing languid film about the intersection of individuals and lifestyles.
Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film.",1,1,0.8281380831915656

"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.

When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.

EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""

""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.

Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.

Beth Bradley.

Liar. Sinner. John. ""

There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.

"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience.  Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life.  The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!

"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.

"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless.",1,1,0.9754010545096252

"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!",1,1,0.9871373896800383

"I love period dramas, and I thought the the premise of the series, the start of the New South Wales penal colony towards the end of the eighteenth century would certainly be of interest. Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season. Not even the excellent acting could validate the almost ridiculous plotlines. Still, I derived some enjoyment from this series, if only because cause I have a soft spot for period dramas.",1,1,0.9542089615123869

Kate and her daughter live in a house that is falling apart around them. She was married for five years to an abusive husband. There is a mystery surrounding Joseph's death and his brother Ryan is holding it over her head. I sympathize with the h's that Anderson creates. Her h usually tend to have a handicap or dark past of some kind. The H is usually strong and protective and neither are disloyal or unfaithful to one another. Miranda is an adorable four year old but I have to say Chloe from Silver Thaw has been my favorite up to tis point. Zach McGovern is Katie's neighbor and as hard as Kate tries to keep him away from her and Miranda she finds herself caring for him right under her roof. The relationship between the two is slow at first but when you learn of Kate's first marriage it makes sense. What a nightmare she went through and with Ryan still threatening not just her but violence to her little girl she leans on Zach for protection. That is always my favorite part when the h finally puts her trust in the H. He does not disappoint either. The trouble I had with the book was it's similarities to Silver Thaw. The h in ST was nicknamed Mandy just as the little girl in this read. Chloe refers to the H as Mr. Jeb and Daddy Jeb. Miranda calls the H Mr. Zach and papa Zach. There are legalities to be dealt with in both as well. It is still a good read and the author takes her characters on their journey nice and slow so you really feel the bond between them. The love scenes take a back seat but you will still find it within. The healing and building of trust is the main point that the author drives home topped off with love. If you're looking for a steamy book this book will not fill your need as it shows the softer side of love.,1,1,0.9341832598621413

"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.",1,1,0.992551328467149

"This is the perfect story to read when you have a few hours free and you just want to dream away and relax for a little while. Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.

Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!

Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.

I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.

"Forget that this is War and Peace and just enjoy it as an excellent Hollywood movie.  If you want something that approximates Tolstoy's War and Peace, then check out the Russian adaptation made in 1968.  The 1956 Hollywood version is under-appreciated; the 1968 Russian version is over-praised.  It's a pity that we couldn't have the heart of the 1956 version and the intelligence of the 1968 wrapped up in the same film.

The solution:  If you want Tolstoy's War and Peace, then read it.  It's a long novel, but it not a difficult novel. But as far as movies go, the Hollywood treatment works well.

A few years have passed since I wrote the above review.  I liked the film even better on a third viewing.  It's not Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, but it's a good movie.  Think of it as another Gone With the Wind.  Maybe this War and Peace only deserves 4 stars, but Audrey Hepburn always rates an extra star or two.",1,1,0.8108040137783612

"Earth Songs (2012) - (Narrated By Michael York - Actor), (Directed by Brian Luke Seaward - Expert in stress management, mind-body-spirit healing) is the most succinct argument against doing what may have been intended to be an inspirational voice-over in an otherwise visually breathtaking production I've seen recently.  I'm writing this as I'm almost done watching the program on 'mute'.  I frankly couldn't take the insipid palaver.  For about two minutes at the beginning, I was hoping the pap-y-talk would change to something informative or smarm-free.  It didn't.

Here's proof that a fairly accomplished actor with a British inflection can't actually keep up with stunning cinematography when trying too hard to say grammatically correct but meaningless, flowery verbiage.  The attempt to sound poetic is pathetic.  This production is the 'nature' equivalent of the Roman Polansky film Tess (1979) - Gorgeously shot, lifeless, bland, and numbingly tedious.  You find yourself wishing that something would happen.  It doesn't, but Michael York drones on relentlessly anyway.

If you're considering watching this production, let alone buying it, I'd recommend you find something interesting to watch instead.  That way you won't miss the good parts due to having your head snap back, swallowing your tongue, and dying a horrible death from the verbal anesthesia in this production.",1,1,0.9901258768494874

"In `Talk Before Sleep' Elizabeth Berg displays the dynamics of the female friendship in such a moving and realistic way that this could be a true story, only it's not.  Berg explains that she wrote the story to help sort out her experiences during her own friend's death, and this connection between herself and her characters keeps them real and alive.  You will not often find a book in which the characters so confidently propel the story forward.
Ruth is dying of caner, it's plain and simple.  Though she toys with the idea of `curing' herself, it's pretty apparent that she will be leaving her friends before she should have to.  But like so many of Berg's books, this story is really about  Ann, Ruth's maternally-inclined friend, who temporarily sacrifices her husband and daughter to care for Ruth in her home.  While Ann is waiting on Ruth hand and foot (emotionally, physically and medically) there is plenty of time for flashbacks that take the reader through the women's friendship; through divorces and children and all the messy stuff that life is made of.  While Ruth's other friends also play intricate parts in the story, the focus really is on Ann and what she will choose to retain from her friendship with Ruth and this phase of her life.
Even though the subject is somewhat grim, I enjoyed reading this book.  One thing that is always consistent in Berg's writing is that she doesn't skip over the less-attractive parts of the human nature, so when you're reading you find yourself easily relating to one or more of her characters.  Reading is so often such a solitary thing, but when it becomes interactive it stays with you.",1,1,0.9884721640969097

I don't know how I would have picked it up with the third book, but I'll try to keep my fingers crossed.

Overall, I liked the first book and the second one.  It's very easy to read and very interesting.  I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, fantasy, and sci-fi.  It's definitely a must read for anyone who loves historical fiction.I love the characters and the plot.  I love the way the author kept the story moving and how it was told.  I love the way she handled the story line and how the ending was so unexpected.  I really enjoyed the book.This is a great book to read on your own. It's not a history",0,0,0.01950097701435738
"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.",1,1,0.8402874789836572
"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

**About the music:

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

Ballet + adagio classical music = peace + calm + relaxation

this dvd is the best when i need to forget about the world and just breathe and concentrate on movements.",1,1,0.9257109861036993

"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one.",1,1,0.9714150037730365

"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.",1,1,0.936779280080193

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

The colors were unparalleled and the message was clearly yet sensitively conveyed.  It is not a movie with the traditional beginning, middle and end.

"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views. All in all a good book worth reading but has to be supplemented with further readings on the post-war Soviet Union subject.",1,1,0.990644981302542

This Young Adult read is for the young at heart like them and me. It is fun, bizarre, and delightful. Some of the reasons I keep coming back to Regina's short novels

In this adventure, Liberty, a young lady pilot of an airship, goes about her business of bartering items needed in her post end of times world.

On one of her stops to deliver goods, she takes on the task of caring for a robot who has feelings. On a stop to get water fuel for her ship, she encounters other humans.

The adventure begins, and Liberty breaks all of her dead father's rules by engaging the robot and the humans. She finds love, a trait she has been avoiding all her life.

How this all comes about and how Liberty changes are the lessons learned in this novel; some that YA's should learn.

An enjoyable quick read. The way I like it.",1,1,0.9473621400701897

"I am 36 years old, and I have four kids. Last year I decided it was time to lost the extra pounds that didn't come off after my 4th pregnancy, so after browsing amazon for some ideas I stumbled upon Jillian's 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. These videos work. If you are using proper form, working out 5-6 days week, and not overindulging on carbs/dessert you WILL see results. Here are my stats:

April 2009: 124 pounds, 5 feet 4 inches tall,  size 6

Workout/diet regimen: started with 30 Day Shred, moved on to No More Trouble Zones (since it had the longer ab workouts I wanted) for about 1 month almost daily. No diet, just cut back on snacks/dessert.

May 2009: 111 pounds, size 0 or 2 - total weight loss 13 pounds, about 10% of my body weight.

If you are looking to get fit and lose weight, give this video a try!",1,1,0.9896154960040621

"I'm not surprised I enjoyed this story so much or that I read it so fast.  It only took me what seemed like an hour and some change to read the book.  I was intrigued by the characters and their stories.  I really liked how honest Kyra was about the problems former addicts face.

The dynamic between Ellie, Drew, and Jason was very interesting.  I felt bad for her being caught between two of the most important men in her life.  I found Jason and Drew's interactions to be fascinating .  There is a lot of history there and it made for some tense moments as well as emotional ones.  However, only part of it was shared and I'm hoping we'll get more if/when we get Jason's story.

I'm really looking forward to seeing this series develop and getting to know more about the band members and their stories. Kyra has written an emotional story that shows she's done a lot of research.  It's one I thoroughly enjoyed reading.",1,1,0.8563920829548352

"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.",1,1,0.9766451058216434

"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.

Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)

The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.

The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.

Go back and read the first three or four in the series, especially before Qwill moved to Pickax. They were certainly light reading, but the plots were intriguing, the writing was tighter and the books then deserved their Best Seller status.",1,1,0.9854734428070901

"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).

*Review copy received from InkMonster Book Club

WOW!!!

I really enjoyed this book. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance in it. There was also some sex. There was also a bit of a cliff hanger, and I'm not sure if it was due to the ending or because I didn't want to put the book down.

I loved the main characters. They were very likable, and the sex scenes were hot. They were also a bit steamy.

I really liked the story. It was a good read. I'm not a fan of cliff hangers, and this was not one. It was a good read. I would recommend it.

"First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

"I'm a survivalist and outdoorsman and love to fish so this fishing vest is right up my alley. I cannot begin to tell you how much room for storage and equipment this gives you. It is amazingly adjustable and is more than comfortable for me(6'3"" 270 lbs) with room to expand, yet if I were 5'10"" and 170 lbs it would be just as comfortable because it literally is made for anyone of any size. That's the kind of stuff I love. Let me give you an idea of how much this can fit. I am able to take along with me in this vest a survival kit including emergency blanket, water purification tablets, two compasses, 50 feet of paracord, mid sized walkie talkie, fire starting materials, set of keys, wallet and spare hooks, line, sinkers and lures.

It doesn't weigh you down, you have multiple pockets, Velcro straps and areas to clip onto. This material is rip stop and tear proof, and incredibly breathable! Comfortable as can be and it looks great. I have seen some vests that look deplorable, this one is incredibly fashionable as is it practical. What I love most is that I don't have to carry an additional bag or rucksack when fishing any longer as this is more than capable of carrying everything I need. With a dry bag in tow I have everything covered. I was provided this item discounted in exchange for a thorough review. The seller asked for honesty even if it was non favorable. That shows integrity and you can be sure you are buying from a reputable and honest seller.

I can't see any outdoorsman not loving this vest. I'm pretty picky when it comes to outdoor equipment and I love it. I trust that you will as well and at this price for what you're getting you can grab a couple of them...",1,1,0.9729765411790271

"""Riddley Walker"" is a post-apocalyptic roadmovie telling the story of its eponymous hero intertwined with the legend of St. Eustace and a bow to Punch & Judy. This unlikely combination serves as the backdrop to a coming-of-age story written entirely in phonetic slang with a healthy helping of dialect based on guesswork as to what terminology might survive.
Getting used to Riddley's language takes some effort, but is well worth it, as his observations on society and long-forgotten history unfold.

"Sex And The Psychic Witch (Crampled)

From The Book: A Novel by Diana Adams

Author: Diana Adams

Publisher: T&E

I enjoyed this book.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over 50 years.  As they are getting older and having to deal with the past, they are facing a new life together.  They are both young women who are very interested in each other.  They are both going through a difficult time, but they are also going through a very difficult time.  They are both trying to make it through the time together.  The story was very well written and the characters were well developed.  I think the main reason I give it 5 stars was because it was a very good story.  I think the book is very well written and the story line is very interesting.  I think I would recommend it to anyone.  I am not sure if this is the best or the worst book",0,0,0.13700823540017387

"Set in 14th century England, Lord of Fairley, Jonathan is being forced to marry. The king has given him two weeks to find a bride, or one will be found for him. In an attempt to help him, his mother enlists the aid of Lady Alice, the daughter of one of her friends, while making it clear to Jonathan that Alice is not a suitable bride for him. Together, Alice and Jonathan make a list of all the eligible ladies at court and begin to plan ways for Jonathan to meet the ladies and determine their suitability.

The meddling by Margaret led to numerous humorous situations, awkward meetings, and two main characters both wondering why the other wasn't a suitable match. Both the plot and characters were relatively straightforward. There were no major plot twists to jump out at readers. The characters behaved true to character, again with few surprises. They were easy to like, if a bit blind to the manipulation going on around them.

This was a cute story. As far as historical romance goes, it was pretty light on historical details beyond the setting and a few period specific situations. As long as readers can picture a royal court, period dress, and a lack of modernity, there is no real need for background knowledge or even interest in historical events.

As it has been a while since my last historical read, this was a fun change of pace. I found myself grinning at Margarets antics and the reactions of both Alice and Jonathan to the maneuvering going on around them. It was an entertaining, quick read, full of humor and fun.

"This is SO lightweight--it's a pleasure to lift. A friend tried this litter and found her cats walked around the house with it stuck to their feet. While all litter sticks to feet, this is light enough to make the trek much farther from the litter box.

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it.

"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

I picked this up for my 9 year old who loves playing baseball. Is he the best player on his team? No. He wants so badly to play shortstop, but isn't the best fielder. He was getting discouraged about always playing in the outfield. He has improved with team practices, but really has no one to help him to practice at home. This net has been amazing because he can go out by himself and throw and catch the ball for HOURS by himself. In a few short days he has already improved his fielding skills and is eager to show them off to coach before his next game.

It was incredibly easy to put together. All the pieces are labeled ON THE ACTUAL PIECE, so once you take it out of the plastic you can STILL identify it exactly which piece it is. One piece had the ""snap"" on the wrong side so it's not exactly ""snapped"" into place, but it still holds. I double checked the instructions and it just looks like I got a wacky piece.  The net goes on easy. Once you get a rhythm down it's easy to snap on without pinching any fingers, but still be careful.

The instructions also include instructions on where to throw the ball for which types of rebounds.

As amazing as this product is, I only rated it 4 stars for because of the wonky piece that doesn't snap and because it's not very compact making storage an issue. The kick stand is the only thing that folds (which keeps the net nice and tight.) This is something you will need a large space to store as it is large and wavy. We will be storing our in our garage against the wall. It's no big deal, really, but I know some want small and portable--but this isn't it.

"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on.

"And with no further adieu, here is what I think about Captain Phillips.

We have a movie that is based on real events, hence being introduced to the titular character Richard(""Rich"" in the movie). Richard Phillips is given the task of taking command of a ship by the name MV Maersk Alabama. And as he aboards the ship things are running ever so smoothly. However, after taking notice of two not-so-familiar boats that are approaching the ship, our Captain finds himself at the very center of a hostage crisis, and from there, we have our movie.

I should start by saying that I did do some research going into the movie; and although there have been reports that this movie itself is not entirely accurate, I loved Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks has had numerous good/great performances; THIS IS one of his greats. From beginning to end, he personifies the role of the Captain turned hostage very well. And though Barkhad Abdi is relatively an unknown actor, he was equally as great in his role as Abduwali Muse. Great acting.

The situation on screen is almost unbearable; many times during the movie I was holding my breath because of the intensity of the scenes and the savagery of the Somalian pirates. They are not clever, but they have guns, and their leader Abduwali has a motive.

If you have not yet seen Captain Phillips, I urge everyone to give this movie a watch. With Outstanding performances and a notably shrill 3rd act, Captain Phillips gets

The original switch worked fine, but one of the two bulbs died within a couple of weeks. I ended up going back to the original switch and having to replace the second one. I went to Home Depot and found it to be too expensive and a good deal for the time it took to replace one of the bulbs. I returned it and ordered another one. When it arrived it was a little different. The switch has a tiny plastic cap attached to the bottom of the switch and the light is attached to the top of the switch. I had to carefully pull the cap off the light, but it was easy enough.",0,0,0.2165666077583432
"This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.",1,1,0.9873035329405327

"I liked Conspiracy of Paper very much, but Liss is even more successful with The Coffee Trader.
The plot is extremely intricate, and the reader must work to stay with it, but the work pays off in a terrific resolution.
Though I admire Liss's attention to detail and historical veracity, what I most appreciate is that his characters are convincingly three-dimensional.  Few people are all good or all bad, yet the proliferation in modern fiction of characters who are no more than straw men is appalling.  Liss gives a reader characters that are convincing in their strengths, flaws, and manifold complexities.
All in all, this is one of the better suspense stories of recent years, and I recommend it without qualification.",1,1,0.9693691663486602

"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

Use 1 pack of Knox Gelatin and 2 cups of water and 2 rounded cups of Bird Seed. Prepare Gelatin per directions.  You can use 2 packs if you want the seed cake more firm.  They might even last longer, but I can't imagine the birds like it.  This makes 2 mini bundt ""Bird-Day Cakes"".

Mix together and pour/pack into mini bundt cake molds that have been sprayed with your favorite non-stick spray. (Gotta have the hole in the center for this feeder.) Place in refrigerator until set.

We use Shell-less seeds for this.  They are expensive and you can certainly use regular bird seed or whatever your favorite bird loves.  We only use 1 cake at a time and haven't stacked them yet. The birds finish this off in 2-3 days.

"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.

It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.

"I purchased this lightweight wonder from Big Lots for a great price. My 503 sq ft apartment, which has hardly any closet space, is too small for a heavy duty large vacuum. This vacuum is very easy to put together with only 2 pieces that go on to make it a complete upright vacuum. (No tools needed!)

OK but my SHARK NAVIGATOR LIGHT IS BETTER!
1. I cut my hair weekly with clippers and hair is either on the countertop or tile floors. The handheld got my countertops hair free and my tile floors were quickly cleaned.
2. The pet hair (white/brown shih tzu's long hair) was picked up in 1 swipe on kitchen tile floor, which usually takes me forever with my broom to get up.
3. The crevice attachment is amazing to clean windowsills, crown molding ledges, ceiling fan blades, and those spider webs in those hard to reach corners. Yes, my Spring cleaning began as soon as I purchased this cheap but helpful vac!
4. Cleans carpets as an upright but you will have to go over spots several times to get it squeaky clean and the suction is good enough to leave carpet lines.) By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!

"In a world of Elena's, Sookie's, Bella's and Buffy's it is refreshing to have a somewhat campy novel about vampires that isn't all blood and lust.

Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.

This story really reminds me of the early Queen Betsy books - you know the GOOD ones - and is a funny yet engaging tale that kept me entertained the entire read.  I really hope that this turns into a series as Queen Betsy should just be staked already and I'm looking for a new fun series to take its place.",1,1,0.9771157610649546
"Finally seem to have found a better balance with the sound of the G-7. If you have an older iPod, you may want to get the TRS-80.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

While working there , she sees a handsome bouncer, whose name is West. She really likes West and would love to get to know him better but thinks she is beneath him, that she is no good for him
One day her mom shows up and tells her that her dad is in trouble, the mob is after him and they needs a lot of $$$$$$ to get him out of it or things will get real bad, real soon. Bianca decides she has no choice but to rob the Grand. Its not like, as she sees it, shes rolling in the money. West, whom she has been slowly talking to, sees she is in trouble and wants to help but knows she won't say a word, keeps wait, watches and hopes she will say something. The attraction, the chemistry between these two are some explosive and electric. Will they or won't they is the question. And will West still want Bianca when all is said and done. Their love story is so beautiful and so full of emotion. There is a lot of pain built into this story. And there is darkness in this story. I loved reading it, feeling it as I read and it kept me on my toes which is Im sure what the characters felt. We see and can feel the human frailties in this story and also can feel the pain yet the hope and that is something Skye Warren does really well. I love how West wants to protect Bianca and does this sweet , alpha man act really well and oh my gawd, it did it soooooooooo well. I want a man like this. Bianca was so worried she would lose him but the ending will show us the HEA. I cannot wait for the next book in the series!

"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.

"Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles is called to a gruesome scene early on Christmas morning, where a young woman has been brutally killed and dismembered, with satanic symbols all around her body and the Latin word ""Peccavi"" (I have sinned) scrawled backwards across her bedroom wall. Detective Jane Rizzoli, back on the job after maternity leave, suspects a serial killer is on the loose when Maura's nemesis, psychiatrist Joyce O'Donnell, is murdered in the same manner. Dr. O'Donnell was part of a group of scholars from around the world calling themselves the Mephisto Club that track demons. When members of this group are murdered and Maura's life is threatened, the action moves to Europe in search of a young woman whom the Mephisto Club is certain will draw the demon to them.

This captivating thriller touches on a fascinating subject: demonology, its origins and presence in the world today. Gerritsen's outstanding characterization is once more on display along with a thrilling, fast-paced plot. Jane Rizzoli remains a strong character, a jaded woman whose marriage and baby have become a calming force. Maura is a lonely woman intrigued by a priest, and this relationship is a painful one for Maura as well as the reader, who longs for Maura's happiness. Gerritsen offers a galvanizing look at Rizzoli's parents, the two people who shaped her, which helps the reader understand her cynicism and insecurities. An electrifying read.",1,1,0.8921031245760936

"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?

As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl

One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

Couldn't go wrong for a free purchase but the carrot that was dangled in front of my face at the end did not entice me to move on to the next book.",1,1,0.9706910817736549

"Would have given 2.5 starts, but the quality is just too good.

The only downside is that the range is a bit narrow.  The TV is not wide enough, so that means it takes up a lot of space.  I wish it had a bit more width for the corners.  I have a 2.5"" Sony LCD TV with a Sony projector and the Sony speakers are great.  I wish there was more on the way.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.  I would have liked the fact that the TV is a little longer than I would have liked.

Overall, this is a great buy and I would recommend it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sony TV for a very reasonable price.I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a little smaller than the typical keyboard, but it's a little lighter than she expected.  It works really well for my needs and is well-made.  The only thing I wish was that it had a tab to adjust the volume, which it doesn't do.  She has this keyboard now for her iPad, but I can't imagine that",0,0,0.026933324602568427

"This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",1,1,0.9250649001262746
"I have several stashes (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency rations and several 'bug-out' bags as I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hits the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasions to replenish my office stash as I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points:
1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect as the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bars themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper has been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bars are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bars TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is bases on 1,200 calories per day (3 meals a day for 3 days at 2 bars per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calories per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bars are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, does not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergencies and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: as I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catches the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off.",1,1,0.9876664064693476
"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable.

"A longtime fan of the author, I was thrilled to see this book in the Vine program. I love Gabby's upbeat, positive, yet no-nonsense and very realistic voice. She tells it like it is, breaking down her lessons, and her life, into small meaningful chapters which pull the reader in and carry him or her through to the lesson and the meaning. This book isn't the ""pollyanna think and you'll be happy"" refrain that some authors offer. Instead, Gabby brings you into the harsh light of day, giving real life examples to the lessons, and honestly, and sometimes painfully sharing aspect of her life which a lesser person might have kept hidden.

Gabby is an inspiration to all of us spirit junkies out there, the meaning to keep trying and carry on, yet she challenges the reader to change, to look at her life in a new way, and in the end, Spirit Junkie will take the reader on a journey of introspection, transformation, and love.",1,1,0.9609120122652888

"This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass.

"As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that.",1,1,0.9459030416673206

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",1,1,0.7273330874308706

"This is the best book I've read in 2017 -- funny, sad, entertaining, totally satisfying, At the end (a denouement I never expected), I wanted to turn back and read it again to watch for the preparation and clues Towles had scattered throughout.

What's to be said about a book in which the protagonist (a Former Person to the Bolsheviks, Count Rostov to his friends) is under house arrest in a Moscow hotel for 40 years, Nikita Khrushchev plays a very small part, and New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury's overcoat is crucial to the way it all works out?  But the plot isn't the best part -- it is Towles' light-hearted prose style. Though he doesn't let the reader forget the horrors that were occurring outside -- massive starvation, five-year plans that didn't work, World War II -- what is important here is one man's mastery of his circumstances.",1,1,0.9560835557861679

"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such.
I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper.
How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change. Is it odor or something else that is distressing him? 40+ yrs as a cat owner and veterinary professional has me looking at all issues. Please no comments in cat litter box behavior...I've spent my life helping others. I just wonder if he hates this whole contraption as much as I do?

"If you are interested in getting a feeling for the awful events that plagued Rwanda during the genocide acts recently - this is a great presentation of the events, based on my knowledge. It is kind of documentary and drama blended together.

What is striking, given the date of this review, is just how ludicrous the world can be. It is shameful! People knew the events were taking place but with no oil or resources for nations to maul there was no interest to lend a hand. There are no acts of humanitarianism by super powers, just self fulfilling acts that benefit leaders of nations - self interest. Take the wikileaks for example that are surfacing today. The ""problem"" is the leaks? How can that be? The leaks are documents of criminal acts by leaders of governments - so why is the site questioned and not the leaders?

If you want to get a sense of international mismanagement - I feel we have the responsibility to do so, please watch this video. Other sources on the topic would include Darfur now, and The History and Sociology of Genocide (see below).

This video is a great entertaining presentation of an event we should not have to document.

These are simply LEDs soldered to a circuit board that passes current through it, allowing all LEDs to receive power.

"I was very disappointed to find that there is NO Vimeo app available, as it has been for previous models.

I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.

Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""

Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.

*** three month update ***
Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

Rating now downgraded to two stars.

My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony.

Greg was the one that brought her too the other partners and the first partner she was with. In this story we not only get to see Gregs kinky nature but his teasing one too.

"Comprehensive look at the immediate future for human employment as computers take over.  Uses his experience with computer chess programs to obtain some insights into human-computer combinations for the future.  For example, humans+computers beat humans alone easily and also beat computers alone.  Also, note that existence of computers smarter than humans (in chess) does not stop popularity of watching human vs human playing, or of matches of human+computer vs human+computer -- but no one wants to watch computer vs computer for very long (p. 156)!  My analogy:  we don't watch locomotives race either.  Also, p. 99, suggests that understanding how current chess programs work gives good clues to ways computers ""think,"" and how that is (will be) different from us.

Some Notes and Quotes:

(p. 8) ""If you and your skills are a complement to the computer, your prospects are likely to be cheery.""

(p. 8) Likely best future for us is commercial coalition Canada-US-Mexico.

(p. 46) Fig. shows civilian labor force available as fraction of total adults (?) went from 55%  1950-1970 to 65% from 1980-2010.  He seems to make a big deal of this, I don't see it.  Women went to work after  the baby boomers left home, so?

(p. 61) increasing number of American workers turning to self employment partly due to high unemployment.

 (p. 136) Re: worries about machines taking over production: ""If just about everyone has a stake in the machines, this could be a utopia.""  In other words, buy stock in companies going to full automation. Or, government tax on machines, as someone else suggested.

Has good discussion of what Turing originally meant by his ""test"" (not what you think).

Chap. 9.  Argues outsourcing and immigration are not cause of American unemployment; actually, we do better when we allow more immigration.

"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down.

"With the soft sounds and colors, this toy is a superb companion for any toddler and introduce him/her to the subtleties of music. Our 15 months old liked this toy but it is a bit early for him to get engaged with it. It seems to be more suitable for an 18 months old as recommended by the manufacturer or even older toddlers who gain basic understanding of cause and effect and the rhythms in the sound.

I wish the string was longer than mere 9"". The center of the wooden handle with string is about 12"" long in total. That is too short even for average height toddler. Kids do not pull toys with hands stretched all the way down. Most of the time he pulls the string at chest level which renders the toy hanging in air instead of being a pull toy.

It is very good for a sit down play and can engage a toddler if he gets interested in music. Otherwise, as a pull toy it may not work successfully. With the current price range, I would expect that the designers in the company must have thought through this aspect.

"After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.",1,1,0.9717747227831722
"So I've somewhat accepted the premise of the game, but I'm not happy with the way the cards are so small. The cards are solid and clear, and the game is very educational.

The cards are in good shape, and the board is very compact. There are no cards that get lost in the game, and I'm not sure if it would be so bad if it did. It does make it fun for my 8 year old, but I feel like it's not worth the price of admission.

"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!

The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.

While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain.",1,1,0.9853476840661167

"Stephanie Plum is hunting down Sandy Claws, a Failed-to-Appear, who definitely resembles Santa, since he is hiring elves to make toys for Christmas. Stephanie has some help with hunting down Sandy Claws and unfortunately it's not Ranger or Morelli. No a supernatural being named ""Diesel"" has popped into her kitchen and is offering to help locate Sandy and get into the Christmas spirit. With a few days until Christmas, there is plenty of time to get into trouble, blow up a car or two and get into a tussle with elves, which is exactly what Stephanie does.

I do love the Stephanie Plum books. I read them years ago and I'm now re-reading them as audiobooks. Visions of Sugar Plums seemed like the perfect listen while I was doing all my holiday baking, and it was. It was certainly fun and over-the-top and what we expect from Janet Evanovich. I like that even though this is just a novella we saw all my favorites, well except for Ranger, and there were some hilarious moments with Grandma Mazur.

I've listened to quite a few of these books with the narration by Lorelai King and I like her voice. She's certainly become the voice of Stephanie, Lula and Grandma Mazur for me. Her voice for Diesel seemed a little slow to catch my interest, but by the end I enjoyed it as much as the others.

"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that was Allegiant, which was in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book was available for free at my library and the other books I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short stories is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the stories themselves, knowing the truth behind everything as revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I was forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these stories for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the stories were just okay. While we do learn some new details about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which covers a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it was just. okay. Altogether the collection was a three-star read. There was nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library. (Oh, and if you're going to buy it in e-book format, buy them separately.

""The Risk Pool"" is of nowhere near the same quality as ""Empire Falls"", ""Nobody's Fool"", ""Everybody's Fool"" or ""The Bridge of Sighs.""

"The single DVD version with the concept of the ""probes"" being sent from a future human race was a very upbeat and inovative plot device for this vision of Earth-after-man. That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!
So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied. While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions. The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.
Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting ""FIRE"" long after the smoke has cooled. So be it. This is one of the very few times that the more intellectual cut was all wrong.

We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was.

Been reading the reviews here and don't understand the business about the aspect ratio.  If the reviewers had only the DVD version and not the Blu-ray, then maybe so.  This is what the High Def Digest review says regarding that:
30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels. There is slight softness in the overall image, but Id wager that is by intention as fine detail doesnt suffer. For a musical it offers a lot for the eyes to see and enjoy.

"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.  Well worth anyone's time.",1,1,0.9702845802234858

"Having an elderly cat (18) and two younger cats, we were running into issues where the regular food was to hard for my old fellow to chew, and in a very short period of time, he lost a lot of muscle, dropping from 17 pounds to only 10. I tried some specialty ""older cat"" food that stopped the weight loss, but of course both of the younger guys (a 22 pound Ragdoll and a 16 pound tabby mix) thought that the food the elder got was best, and protested their food, too. And, of course, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to feed to three large cats, two of which are super active.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared. We still use a wet food supplement for the older cat (which, of course, the young guys love, too) to maintain his weight and health until he passes, but we are in the region now where we won't have to auction off one of our teenagers just so we can feed the cats!",1,1,0.964283140985201

"Meena Harper is a typical woman living in NYC - she picks the wrong men, says the wrong things (aka predicts people's deaths), and attracts vampires. Okay, so maybe she isn't a typical NYC woman, but what she is is a fun character. In this sequel to Insatiable, readers are welcomed back into her life six months after the first novel ends.

As the novel opens, readers see Meena as a serious agent for the Palatine. Her brother Jon is still trying to get a job with the Palatine. Alaric still wants Meena. Lucien still wants to make Meena his bride.

And that's just the start of it. There is a rising vampire army hunting Meena; there is the Palatine hunting Lucien; and there is something ""off"" about the new members of the Palatine.

With a fast-paced plot and quite a few twists and turns throughout, Cabot has written an intriguing sequel. If you enjoyed Insatiable, you will not be disappointed with Overbite.

On a final note, I just want to say how much I really enjoy Cabot's taking on vampirism. She is clever, funny, and satirical, making these some of my favorite Cabot novels. This is the reason I gave it 5 stars instead of 4.",1,1,0.9526587207015801

"Okay, it's true.  I love Fannie Flagg books. Her characters are delightful, engaging, and quirky, but always memorable!. This summer, I've been reading some pretty heavy books about WWII, so I needed something light and fun. I turned to Flagg and her book about Elner Shimfissle.  Just from the name of the main character alone, you know you are in for a fun time. Elner touched so many lives for good over the course of her long life that her death, its aftermath, and visit to heaven, make for some laugh out loud reading.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes implausible, humorous books with feel good results and characters.",1,1,0.9244663624551583
"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!

"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.",1,1,0.9709526918907434

"This is very light for a Feld game.  I've played other light Feld games such as Builder's Duel and The Speicherstadt but for the most part his games tend to be meatier/deeper experiences.

In this game players draw 3 cards each turn.  Each card has 3 possible uses and players determine which card is going to be used for each of the three functions that turn.  One will be used to give the player a special ability, the other to get a resource, and the last to move an animal track marker up.  In between the second and last action players also put an explorer on a board in order to surround and collect animal tiles.  These tiles are the main source of points in the game.  The game lasts until the animal track markers are at a certain level and the player with the most points wins.

I typically really like the mechanic of cards being used for multiple different purposes and having to choose which role to fit each of your 3 cards in each turn presents a lot of opportunity cost decisions that make this game, despite being reasonably light, also reasonably deep and engaging.  There's a little bit of competition and reading your opponents as everyone is playing in the same space and especially with more players there can be competition for certain aspects of the game.  That said, the game is a lot more interesting with more players.  It is fine with 2, but each player can tend to focus on their own thing and there is less interaction.

The accessibility is a great boon for this game, this is a game that is quick to get up and running with almost anybody and because it is still reasonably engaging and deep you don't sacrifice that in making a lighter game.",1,1,0.9517970091498525
"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.

I also noticed that my lens hood was not able to hold the lens in the case that I was holding. This was due to the lens hood not having enough space for the lens hood.

"I have no doubt that if I had no life outside of reading, I would've finished this book in a day. With my schedule, it took 4 days, and I truly enjoyed it!  You have to love a book that leaves you smiling as you read the last lines of the book and then sends you to the internet immediately to buy book 2. Charley Davidson is a ""grim reaper"", but not in the traditional sense that we all know. She is a portal through which those who didn't immediately cross over can use to get where they're supposed to go - presumably Heaven. The dead see her as this bright light, which they are usually drawn to, and she sometimes has to help them with their unfinished business before they are ready to cross over. She is also a very witty, sarcastic Private Investigator, and she's very good at it, with the help that she receives from some of the dearly departed. Oh, and there's this supernatural being that comes to her in the night in her dreams and has his way with her, and she's pretty happy about it. While I'm not one who is drawn to those lusty, cliche romance novels, I do love paranormal fiction and suspense, so this book fit the bill. Add to that, Charley's sarcastic sense of humor, which I am all over, and this made for a very quick, enjoyable read. The book is peppered throughout with little sarcastic one-liners, some of which had me laughing out loud and feeling silly, since my family had no idea what was so funny. Some reviewers commented that they were excessive, and maybe so, but not to the point where it might have taken away from my enjoyment of the book. If you have similar tastes, I highly recommend this book. If you're a bit on the prudish side, maybe not so much.",1,1,0.9432619771151636

"I am a big fan of the underrated, marvellously talented late Robert Lancing, so I collect his stuff.  And he did some wonderful B flicks that are B Movie Addicts delight.  My favourite 4D man is one of the best, but this one is not too shabby.
Joan Collins is head of a group pushing an island paradise resort - yet to be built - and Lancing is the pilot of the boat that brings in the latest boatload of suckers....I mean investors...to view the imaginary golf course and club house.  Only problem, refugees from THEM! are lurking in the woods making off with islanders and soon to investors of Joan's resort.  The effects are typical Drive-in B movie quality (but hey, I miss the old drive-ins!! When I visited Kentucky they would have dusk to dawn creature features and that is where I first saw this movie), but Lancing as always is better than the material he is given and makes this worth the ticket.
So stack up four of five our your best Vincent Price and Chris Lee films, add Empire of the Ants (and watch the wonderful and well missed Robert Lancing), pop a bowl of popcorn , turn out the lights and imagine you are in a car with a speaker hanging from the window.  Have your own dusk to dawn creature features.

Yes, the first ended in a cliffhanger, but you listened to your fan base when you asked how long to wait between releases. People who know me, will tell you how much I despise cliffhangers. So glad you decided to release them close together. As much as I loved the first book, I can tell you without a doubt that I enjoyed this one so much more. Let me list the ways. 1. I received the answers to all of my unanswered questions in the first novel. 2. The player was finally tamed, and holy crap it was awesome. Once again the sex was smokin' hot. And not only that, we also got to see Xander's sweet and vulnerable sides. Love it!

This is a great speaker for the price and I am very happy with it.  The sound quality is not great but it is good enough to use as a laptop.  The only issue I have is the battery life.  I have had a 3 year old and the battery life is not as good as this.  I would not recommend this speaker.  I have had a few of these speakers before, but this one is not the best and the sound quality is not good.

I would recommend this speaker to anyone who wants a good quality sound, good price, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good sound.I needed something to carry around when I travel and I wanted a little more space for my laptop.

"Veiled by L. Chapman is a story about losing the one you love and finding someone when you least expect it. Jenny is put through more than one could imagine as she begins to feel her pending nuptials are in danger of panning out. Her fianc, Rich, has become withdrawn in their relationship. Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Much to Jenny's surprise, she finds her husband with another man. He is honest with her and explains the possibility of a health risk. The two are not on speaking terms thanks to this shocking revelation. After tests and full disclosure to Warren, they continue to get closer with their feelings. Knowing her whole world is changing right before her eyes, Jenny decides to move on the best she can and let things take their rightful course.

Veiled ends one happy ending and gives hope to finding a new one. The plot moves quickly as it seems a black cloud is following Jenny everywhere she goes. Her share of bad luck surely must be about to end soon. I was happy to see Mark and Megan were still going strong in their relationship. Baby Lucy is cherished and loved by her little family. Unfortunately, it was hinted that there would be upcoming turmoil with Lucy's custody.

"If you've watched director David DeCoteau's previous movies (The Brotherhood series, The Frightening, Leeches), then you pretty much know what to expect:

1) buff young studs running around in their underwear for no apparent reason

2) slomo sequences that are so dull and repetitious, and used mainly to add minutes to the movie;

3) plots with holes the size of the Grand Canyon;

4) lots of bad acting;

5) awful music of any genre.

SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.

"While I still enjoyed aspects of this series, I found this book unnecessarily complex in its mythological meanderings. I am not exactly sure was Atticus did with Granuaile for 12 years, but that might have been more interesting than this book. Things progress on the Granuaile arena, at least.

I think the conversations with Oberon seemed to get a bit too much (too cute by half) and got in the way of the story. As other reviewers have noted, I have been bothered by the brevity of these books and it sure does seem that Hearnes is using mythological twaddle as filler for his recent books. I enjoyed the first few much more, perhaps because they were anchored more in the real world. In the last couple of books there is a magical deus ex machina to solve all the problems of the complicated mess Atticus seems to have made for himself.

"Play-doh equipment has always looked super fun on the shelf at the store.  However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

Things that could be improved, ideally there would be a way or a tool to make the correct shaped log, or a way to just stuff play-doh in and it still work without jamming up.",1,1,0.959952415744479

"The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.

I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.

I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.

"This novella is a very good addition to the Nemesis Unlimited series. Ada has been given an assignment to gather evidence against an aristocratic couple. This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books.",1,1,0.9310254650998185

"Leigh finally has to face the fact that she does indeed have feelings for Ryan that go deeper than surface lust. But she's still a girl who does her best to stay rooted in reality, and without concrete answers about where Ryan came from, it's difficult for Leigh to let go and fully trust the man who has her heart.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming elements of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scenes and seriously swoon-worthy actions by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K. Munt delivers another memorable book hunk that rivals Tristan from her well-known Fairytail Saga. This is the kind of romance that should be accompanied by a folding fan.",1,1,0.9529673565672676

"Ordered this to frost my bathroom window. Followed directions to a T and the results were very impressive. There is no way to tell from sight that the windows were treated with a spray, no streaks, no thin coated areas of the glass. As long as you use it per the instructions it will work as intended. Now for the bad part. As I was putting on the final coat of the spray it started to sputter. There is about half the can left so no reason for it to seem ""out of gas"". Noticed an accumulation of the  spray in liquid form around the nozzle which seems to be causing the sputtering. If I can get the nozzle to work without sputtering then I can use it to frost one more window. I will try to clean it with warm water see if the nozzle will clean up for use, but if anyone has other suggestions I am open to it.

"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with.",1,1,0.9730844243370926

"Searched for a hard surface vac for weeks to a better job on my hard surface floors, wood and porcelain tile...reading reviews on numerous vacs from $$ to $$$.  I actually got down to 2 Bissell, and decided to go with the bagless. Placed my order and it was here in a day it seemed.  What a great little vac....!!!!  Super power but with a button system conveniently located on the handle to reduce the suction to do my rag rugs and not suck them up...tools I most use, crevice and little brush right on handle...easy to dump, other filters easy to get at if needed.  Cord rewinds.. love the hard surface tool...little soft brushes that get the dirt but take care of my wood floors.  I notice I no longer have to go back over the floors with a dust mop to get the dust, this little sweeper gets it all.  Price is absolutely right and I was prepared to pay much more.  Very light weight but follows along with me fine...I have to move the cord a few times but no big deal, wand has plastic hook that sets it right on vac neatly for storage.

"A collection of stories inspired by the ""unsolved mysteries"" of ancient women. This book FASCINATED me. Ms. Guillaume took bits of history and asked ""what if?"" We don't often think of ancient women proposing a theeesome or sexually dominating a brand-new husband, but Guillaume leads readers to believe it's not only possible but likely to have happened.

My favorite stories were ""How the Lotus Blossoms"" (a possible origin for the barbaric foot-binding tradition in China, ""Buktu's Well"" (possible beginnings of the Timbuktu trading post in Mali), ""The Girl with the Golden Eye"" (a young woman with a prosthetic eye sees the future during orgasm), and ""Queen of Beauty"" (possible explanations for the mystery surrounding Nefertiti's unfinished bust and her disappearance after her husband's death). ""Queen of Beauty"" made me cry.

Some of the other stories were a little fetishy, challenging my ability to suspend disbelief, but there is enough excellent writing and variety to make this book well worth its five stars.",1,1,0.958593843060036

"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

"I bought this to replace a smaller pack. It's worked out well for me. I have carried upwards of 80+ lbs. with no problems several miles. Not quite sure about the two loops on the lower back area. Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )

"Well, that's that... I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening.  I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.
I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

"Judith Kriger's ""Animated Realism"" really helps me understand the relationship between two women. The first couple of pages are about the two people, both of whom have a shared interest in religion and politics. They both have been in the same boat for years.

Both of whom have been very interested in religion and politics. They both have been very interested in politics, and they both have been very interested in their marriage.

"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying.",1,1,0.9870682661053068

Changing the blade and re-tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do.

"Taming the Vampire is a wonderful read.

Liz is every bit the warrior she was bred to be while Jack is the perfect seductive vampire. Both on the hunt for a mysterious creature that has been leaving a trail of bodies in it's wake. Working together is not something either of the main characters want. For starters, Liz hates Jack and when her friend discovers a way to increase Liz's power, more than doubling her strength and giving her the tools she needs to defeat whatever it is that is lurking and killing in the shadows of Boston, she is repulsed. But after facing the demon on her own, and taking beating, Liz admits, she needs the help and goes Jack with an interesting proposal. If they have sex, she can absorb his power and become strong enough to kill the demon.

For a short paranormal romance, this book has spice and striking characters. As expected for this type of book, the pace was quick and never dull. However, as I was reading I felt as if this was a second book rather than a first in the series. The world building was a little weak, not much background was given of the hunters or the vampires and there wasn't much of an explanation given for what Absinthe really even is. Though, lack of world building has actually made me want to know more and I have already acquired book two, Bound by the Vampire. If you like paranormal romance and don't have the time to delve into a full length novel, I would recommend this series.",1,1,0.972121201216789

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

The only real negative is that the timer is too small to fit in my pocket. I just put it in my pocket and it is on my belt. It's very easy to move it around in my pocket. The light is too small for my liking.

All in all a great product and a great price.I was skeptical at first but after a few months I was very impressed with this little light.  It looks amazing and I can tell you I am very impressed with the quality and the light quality.  I have no complaints about this light.

"Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.",1,1,0.9829657759892179

"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",1,1,0.9860632335576138

And then the fourth chapter, which was yet more characters, not just one or two, but a whole passel of them, some of whom are using their real names and also a nickname and it was just too much. I could not keep all of the characters straight. And I know that the book is told from a series of other characters' viewpoints about a couple of characters, but it's just too much.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!

"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.

"Pros: pretty easy to install, delivers a nice stream of water, good spray pressure, feels sturdy after install, can do the handle left or right, color I wanted. Cons: almost returned because its super tall and clunky looking (not rustic, but not refined), the pull down nozzle does not pull out or retract very smoothly, the pull down nozzle does not set back in place without being very deliberate. I did way too much research and found that most pull down faucets have issues, so I had lowered expectations. I thought I might regret switching from a decent regular kitchen faucet to an arch with a pull down - but it is a very good change. Thought the soap dispenser might be a disappointment - but its been great and super easy to refill. There aren't too many black faucets available currently - I really like black or oil rubbed brass, but oil rubbed bronze is popular right now, which I don't like.

"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.",1,1,0.9820700008333868

"The toilet was making a lot of noise while flushing. I discovered that the similar float unit was leaking. I ordered this part, got it two days later and installed it with no problems. Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store.",1,1,0.9432931703707245

"Judy Holiday won an Oscar for this film, and no wonder: her performance of Billie Dawn, a ""dumb broad"" who suddenly wises up in a most unexpected way, is certainly one of the finest and most original film performances in 20th Century American cinema. The story, from the stage success, concerns a crass junk yard tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who goes to Washington to buy a Senator--and promptly considers that his blonde-bimbo mistress Billie Dawn (Holiday) lacks enough poise for such refined circles.  He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to ""smarten her up.""  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light.
The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.  The film very neatly balances its comic elements with its serious side, and neither predominate nor throw the film off center; director Cukor steers a perfect course.  A must-see and a must-own.",1,1,0.9864893382438541

"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain.

"James Cameron has possibly given movies a new life where 2D movies just do not compare to a 3D visual sensory extravaganza. Going to a theater once again feels worthwhile. This movie is possibly the closest you could get to experiencing what life could possibly be on another planet. I was constantly amazed at the little details like a shrinking plant, a lizard with a parachute thing, bio-connection with other lifeforms and so many other little things within the movie.

The story was not too unique and from a sci-fi perspective, there are better stories out there (Enders Game for example). But what this movie has done is to create a benchmark for a new genre of 3D computer generated movies. The benchmark being both in detail and production quality.

This is possibly the first time I have seen a movie where despite a lukewarm story, I still was 100% focused on the movie and left the theater with the feeling of having experienced a new civilization. It took me some time to digest all that I saw within this movie and I may do another trek to the theater to look at the finer details in the forests once more.

There is a strong eco-friendly and anti-war message throughout the movie with the good and bad guys clearly defined. This one is a monumental work and definitely worth watching.",1,1,0.9750347632964859

"I had an earlier version of this and thought it would be a nice addition to the tool box.

I had to replace a couple of the blades with the new blades.  The saw came with a few loose blades which were very difficult to remove and use.  The blade was not a very good quality blade and it was difficult to use the new blades.  I also had to use a screw driver to remove the blade and replace the blades with a new blade.  The blade did not work for me and I had to use a pliers to remove the blade.  The saw was very sharp and I really liked the saw.  I have not used it for a long time but it looks great in my tool box.  I would recommend this saw for anyone looking for a good quality saw.

Update:  I have now replaced the blades with the new blades.  The saw has a nice finish and I like the look of the saw.  The blade looks very solid and the blade tips are very sharp.  The saw is a bit large for my purposes but I think it is a good quality saw and I would",0,0,0.010472713456879456
This was nice sized but unlike other kong toys is not durable at all.  My 50 lb wirehaired pointer destroyed it in 5 minutes.  The other kong stuffed animals have been awesome.  They still destroy them but it takes a while - like 3 weeks for that to happen.  I will stay with the real tough kong toys.  I don't recommend this toy to any dog that plays somewhat rough - it will not last.  Additional squeakers are a nice thought but they also present a hazard if they can be removed from the toy.

"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft.",1,1,0.984373311040659

"We've all heard the premise before, we all know how it's going to end, but few films take us on such an marvelously silly ride as 'The Other Guys'! This film is played completely for laughs and at no point do you think anything happening is real. It's funny as the only film that came to mind when I watched this movie was Steve Coogan's 'Hamlet 2'(even more hilarious!), which is a different story, but has the same loopy feel. Coogan has a fairly small but intricate role here, but I suspect he helped with the humor or they chose him to be in this because he had the right amount of kookiness they were looking for.

Ferrell has never been funnier and Walberg proves he can do comedy in this farce with a mission to bust your gut! I laughed out loud throughout this crazy flick and it was a welcome change from the standard buddy film. If you're in the mood for supreme goofiness, then 'The Other Guy' will have you laughing hysterically, but if you don't like silly films, then this one might leave you scratching your head.",1,1,0.9564235496920689

The kit itself looked very nice with the orange/grey paracord, but I will admit I hated to take it apart because I figured I couldn't put it back together.  However, I got this for a product review so I proceeded to take it apart.

To my own surprised, I was actually able to put the full kit together - it didn't look as nice as it did when I got it, but still looked pretty good.

The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance. The LED cable is a three conductor cable with a jack and receptacle connection. To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively. No leaks.",1,1,0.9757414451879122
"Amazing toy. Bought one for our 7 yr old niece and played around with it. Seems to be the hotness of 2013. But let's not lose our heads, here. It is merely a reconfigured Nerf Blaster. Instead of a trigger or a pump, you pretend to release a string. Aiming is more luck than skill. Comes with five whole darts.

If they really want to learn about archery, you'd be better served buying a simple 'starter' bow and arrow set for about the same price. Teaches them a skill AND not to shoot their friends! My dad taught me to shoot when I was young and it is still a fun and relaxing hobby for me. This will not teach them anything, but dang, it's fun!

Some advice on the price:
-This retails for abouts twenty dollars. All my local retailers were sold out, and about two hours after purchasing it from Amazon the price here more than doubled. I see a lot of annoyed shoppers giving this one star over the price and that's bad form. You don't like the price, don't buy it. Don't mislead other shoppers about this great, fun product because the vender is gouging. Amazon isn't always the best price. I've seen a few 'hot' products sold for much cheaper locally (Target, WM, TrU) and while Amazon is great for most holiday shopping, in this case, at this moment, they aren't. ALWAYS remember to price check!
-Don't be suckered into buying the 'girly' refills, the ones that match the colors of the bow. They cost more than twice the price of the regular orange ones! (Now THIS is some sexist gouging!) Kids don't care what color their ammo is and not everything girls touch needs to be pink. Save some money and pick up a pack of standard Nerf refills.",1,1,0.9969049327791977

"This board is perfect for quick games as well as teaching beginners. The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance).

The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.

Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!)

Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc.",1,1,0.9877639085666854

Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries.

"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them.",1,1,0.9905924402493788

"Whew, this book may be one of the most intense love stories that I have ever read. I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship. Chloe's best friend is a real hoot and I would have liked to learn more about her character.

Scorching sex scenes are an integral part of this book and Ms. Wolff does an excellent job of creating passion. Overall, a good read.",1,1,0.9605736437027143

"The second book in the Asylums for Magical Threats series is mesmerizing paranormal romance that takes the reader on an adventure.  Fighting to free elemental magic users, Camilla Melini is on a mission to find one of the legendary Four Talents. Marco Alvarez is sent to Mexico with two goals  to watch Cams back and to investigate a series of arson fires. Despite their differences they will have to work together to save their colleagues and to keep the Talent from falling into the wrong hands.

This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.  The author uses well written scenes and events to inspire vivid images that capture the imagination.  Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.

The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes. The bad guys in this series really inspire outrage and anger, only thing is there are so many plots and conflicts going on, the reader not really sure which ones are the bad guys, which of course keeps things real interesting.

The author has created a fascinating world of elemental magic that has surprising twists and turns, intriguing subplots and captivating characters with dazzling abilities that ensure that the reader never gets bored and I was engrossed in this thrilling story from beginning to end and I cant wait to find out what happens next.",1,1,0.9592086460455737

"I wonder sometimes why we write reviews of dog kibble when we ourselves are not end users.  Statistics about ingredients are on all the packages, and I tell you the dogs do.not.care.  They eat !

We have a chihuahua mix and two New Mexican terriers.  They have  slightly different menus, but share the same kibble.

I was not able to see any difference with the bigger dogs in eating the two kibbles.  Seemed to be all the same.  Point being, it was apparently eaten equally in both cases.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

A three becomes a four.  Bigger dogs, just another kibble.  Little dog  more,  daddy.  The difference was astounding.

Try it with your dogs.  It seems to be good stuff to certain  types of dogs.  I rate it a four.",1,1,0.9671895503842554
"The way Cassie and Andrei's relationship developed was believable. However, the chemistry between them and their connection was palpable. They meet when Cassie was being auction by her own parents. My heart went out for her!

Andrei in the other hand had always live in the middle of the violence and dangerous situations working for the Russian Mafia, but there was something that make him help Cassie.

The plot and storyline are well-written. The story is fast-paced, action packed, intriguing and captivating. The rest of characters were likeable, and memorable.

This is a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Mafia/ Organized Crime Genre. Sold to the Hitman is an absolute wild ride.

"My cat, Raoul purchased this during a nocturnal shopping spree. We got him his own credit card with the hope that occasional nighttime internet shopping would entertain him while the rest of the household slept. This works out pretty well most of the time as he usually purchases small inexpensive items such as cans of tuna, bags of Pounce, and electronic dog whistles.

One night, however, he watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0036SLOP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>&nbsp;on Amazon Instant Video and he became extremely interested in flying.  For a few weeks he would climb up on to a tall bookcase and spring, legs outstretched, usually on to the sleeping dog, but sometimes at any unsuspecting passerby.  He must have eventually become bored with free flight because this Cat Airplane arrived one day. Raoul set upon assembling the cardboard pieces and although he was quite methodical, it was beyond his physical ability to complete the job. Of course, we assisted him; the propeller assembly being extremely difficult even for us with thumbs.

At last, the cat airplane was finished and the first thing we noticed is that the cockpit was rather a tight squeeze for a big fellah like Raoul.  He was quite determined and was barely able to squeeze himself in, but he eventually did.  Once in, he really looked fantastic! Purring like mad, he tried to find the controls, but there were none.  Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!

It took lots of explaining on our part to convince Raoul that he had not purchased a real plane but merely a toy. He is quite disillusioned now. He mostly sleeps or sits and stares off into the far distance, a cat with shattered dreams.

Please don't let this happen to your cat!",1,1,0.9967934443335651

Although it does impart so knowledge and insight, I doubt this book is a sanctioned review of the Johnson heirs. This is the 2nd or 3rd book I've read about America's wealthy elite and sadly, they all sound tragically alike. People without jobs and direction flounder to find purpose in their lives.

"When Roger Depue was growing up on the east side of Detroit in the late thirties, it was full of Southerners seeking assembly line work at the automobile factories.  His father was a sharpshotter police officer and the places they lived sound a lot like those I lived in as a child.  He had four brothers, all sharing the same bedroom.

In the sixth grade, he played Jesus in the Easter Passion play at his Catholic school and was on the cross.  This left a deep impact on him, as he always felt Jesus' sacrifice was bravery in action for the greater good.

He reached far beyond his father's law career by becoming chief of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit (a profiler to find serial killers) and spent forty years in law enforcement.  He worked as consultant on the Martha Moxley murder in Mass. and JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder.  His specialty was finding society's most depraved, brutal criminals.

After four decades of staring into the darkness of evil, when his wife of 32-years died, he entered a seminary for three years to search for the good and became a Brother of the Society of the Missionaries of the Holy Apostles Seminary in Cromwell, Conn.

His son, Steven, became a deputy for the Fairfax County, Virginia, police.

Roger earned a BS degree in psychology, Masters in society and law, and PhD in counseling and development from American University.  He was a consultant on the movie, 'Silence of the Lambs, starring Anthony Hopkins.

"This is one Christian film that has the potential to make you cringe.

The film has a couple of redeeming qualities. First, it is a very moving film. Second, it is a well-done movie. I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in the Christian faith.

The only negative I could say is that the ending was a bit slow. I will say that I had to watch it over and over. It was an interesting ending, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good Christian film.This is a great movie.

Great characters, great chemistry between the H/h, excellent plots and twists. You won't be disappointed. My personal beef with books in this genre, is when the heroines are redundantly stupid and frustrating throughout the story. If you can get past that, you will definitely enjoy this series.

"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily...

"I found this book both very confusing and sort of boring. And not only that, but it seemed to drag on endlessly. It took me until mid-way through the third chapter to even figure out that Juliet was a grieving widow, and why? And when she came home and found a naked man in her pool, she acted like she didn't even know who he was, and yet, he had been around for years while caring for her sick husband. I found that really, really odd. There was a lot of the inner thought process going on in both of their heads all through the book, and they weren't even complete thoughts, at that!

It was easy to set up. The only thing is make sure the propeller is properly seated and if the propeller comes apart don't panic. Just press the rubber stops back on to each end of the silver pin.

"Cowell delivers a narrative of what happens when the U.S. becomes involved in the war and the role that the West played in it.  The reader is introduced to a strong and determined young man who is not in the military, but is an American soldier who has served in the field and a woman who is a native of Afghanistan.  The story is told from the point of view of a young soldier who has spent his entire life on the battlefield and has seen much of the horror and devastation of war.

The book is well written and provides insight into the role of the West in the war.  Powell's book is a good read and I recommend it.

"The box is not deep enough, large envelopes and magazines don't drop in the box, you have to pull down the handle to make it drop. The outgoing mail clip is made for #10 business envelopes and slightly larger, if you put a greeting card in there it is visible from the outside. The clip should be mounted on the side of the pull down drawer rather than the bottom to allow you to put larger envelopes in. The box comes with 12 1/2"" holes drilled in the bottom to allow for various mounting configurations, you are only going to use 4. The box should come with 12 plastic plugs to fill the holes not used. Mail boxes sit just 8"" from the curb which very often has water running in it. When the mail truck arrives he can very easily splash water into the mail box from the bottom. The locking door has a gap between it and the mailbox, very easy to insert a small crow bar and pry it open. Information with the box states for extra keys both blank and cut can be ordered online.

"Nice poly bottle, nice filter attachments, and nice top cap with handle.

"I purchased this to replace the Capresso 560 grinder after it broke. The Capresso grinder is quieter, but I love the simplicity of this grinder. Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look.",1,1,0.9469614692509861

"For those like myself who wondered how a bunch of English kids had such a huge impact on pop music in the 60s and beyond, this book explains a lot - a first hand account from one of the most important figures of the British Invasion.  Keith talks about the Stones early influences and how they progressed from covering American Rhythm and Blues to writing their own material and becoming what many considered the greatest Rock and Roll band of their time.

Its a wild ride, full of sex  (Ronnie Spector, Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithful, etc.),  drugs (pot, speed, freebase cocaine, heroin, etc.), and Rock and Roll.

Only disappointment was that even though he talked about a lot of their biggest hits - Satisfaction, Start Me Up, Miss You, Jumpin' Jack Flash, and so on - he didn't say a word about Shes So Cold, which I always thought was a great song, and an important one because it made a statement - that after Disco and Punk Rock had pretty much come and gone, the Stones were still around, and they could still come up with a tune that was better than anything anyone else had out there.",1,1,0.9860021624927615

"I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster.",1,1,0.9877132400984393

"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously.

The romance is a slow burn by necessity, but is very much secondary to the storyline until it's really thrown in James' face what he's been doing all this time. Watching him have to re-evaluate everything he's understood in his life and slowly struggle with new insights (and that he might not be as good a man as he's thought) is the real story of the book, despite the high fantasy surrounding it.

"Choose Yourself & Love You More by Author Lucie Jones

If there is a genre of book that I can identify with...it is an inspirational one!  The Introduction to ""Choose Yourself & Love You More"" is excellent as it quickly addresses the real issue and the difficulties we encounter in learning to love ourselves. It also stresses the need for internal positive self-talk. For many people, it is not so simple to look in the mirror and love what they see and who they are. As stated by Author Lucie Jones, it is very true that ""learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all"".  I'll even go one step further...if you don't love yourself you will never learn to truly love others. Charity really does begin at home. Therefore, I totally agree with her suggestion to have a better look at ourselves and learn to truly value who we are...

From the very first page right to the last, I can clearly see what this talented author's goals are and why she decided to pen this little gem of a self-help booklet. To love ourselves is not a crime...it is a necessity in order to positively change our self-image and move forward. Yes...we all have flaws as mentioned, however, they should not decrease our self-worth and affect how we live our lives. As this motivational author stresses, the benefits of self-love will enhance our opportunities to have better relationships. If we stop beating ourselves up...we will attract people who add to our positive dynamic which will result in healthier relationships. Who could ask for anything more? Great suggestions are given to help us follow a new direction and turn our lives around. It is an excellent place to start!

"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.",1,1,0.965672253344515

"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

"I picked up this book because I'd been wanting to read one of Karen's recent books, Immortal Highlander, but something kept nagging me that I should read one of her earlier books first. I'm glad I did. This was the first book of hers that I read and I LOVED it.

Ms. Moning has a great passion for storytelling. More than once I was tempted to highlight sentences or passages because they were phrased so well. Of course, I was so engrossed in the book that I could not be bothered to put the book down long enough to get a highlighter.

This story is fun to read and is based on supernatural beings called Berserkers which were supposed to have existed in Scotland many years ago. We watch the character of Grimm go through a transformation as he attempts to hide his true nature from the world and then, through circumstance, reveal himself to close friends and to the woman that he loves.

One of the things that I love about Ms. Moning's books is they all have this element of fearing to reveal our true self to the person we love the most, even when that person is the person who understands us best of all. When the moment finally comes to share ourselves, we find that the other person knew the truth and accepted us all along.

I love the scene in the church when Jillian's father says that love involves having passion, so much passion that you'd be willing to kidnap your beloved before she turned to someone else. You really get the sense of divine intervention in this book. This man and this woman are made for one another and no matter what they do to deny it, fate always steps in and thrusts them together until they are ready to accept it.

I highly recommend this book and pretty much anything else by this author. She has a fabulous way of combining celtic mysticism and historical romance without feeling forced.",1,1,0.9795777005646129

"You're at a party.  Or maybe you're at a work event.  And somebody spends the night trying to convince you of who they are.  They're trying to convince you that they are honest or highly creative or a really, really involved parent.  To paraphrase the bard, ""I think thou tries to prove themselves too much.""  Whenever someone tries hard to sell themselves, to sell you on a notion of who they are, they are almost always never that person.  That's all you can take away from one of those ambushes with any certainty.  Why do I bring it up?

This book is the exact opposite experience.  Brett is never trying to convince you of anything.  Story after story, she is nothing but humble and candid.  It's really what elevates the book.  It never reads too preachy and she never claims to know anymore than what her experiences have brought her.  And, so many of her lessons come from those she has watched and studied over the years.  Her time spent as a reporter works so nicely in this book.  She is in every story, but never demands the attention or the spotlight.  And, she never once tries to turn this into an ""issues"" book.  She mentions her own terribly troubled past only when necessary and only in the increments needed to move the story along.  This, I think, allows her own quiet yet clear voice to shine throughout.  Simple, yet elegant.  She must be one heck of a lady.  She never tries to convince me of it, but it's what I walk away with.  Nice, nice piece of writing.

"I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.",1,1,0.9762805971353435

NOAH'S COMPASS features Liam Pennywell.  In the opening pages, we learn that he has lost his job as a teacher and that he is moving from his apartment into a smaller one to economize.  We discover a few other bits and pieces as well:  he has been married twice (he is divorced from his second wife), and he has three grown daughters plus an older sister.  And then, after an exhausting day of moving and having settled gratefully into bed, Liam wakes up the next day in a hospital, with no memory of how he got there.

This is certainly an interesting premise for a novel.  Liam has not forgotten who HE is; rather, he simply has selective amnesia for the events surrounding the break-in to his home (for he is told that is what happened) and everything immediately thereafter.  Initially, he becomes obsessed with getting these memories back, which leads him on sort of a quest, bringing a new woman unexpectedly into his life, Eunice.  But from here, the book becomes much more haphazard, taking many seemingly random twists and turns--e.g., we learn more about Liam's past, there is some development in the relationship with his daughters, etc.

Ultimately, however, there seems to be no true purpose to this story.  Although I found Liam likable and was actually rooting for him, there just wasn't much to root for by the end of the novel.  So, while the reading of this book was mostly enjoyable, the lack of a satisfying conclusion was disappointing, and with that, I give it a final rating of 3 1/2 stars.",1,1,0.9927167763976151

"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

"I got this cover with the idea of having a spare in case I messed up removing material to make the Qi adapter fit better (trying to reduce the lump it makes). It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish. If it's actually ""rubberized"", then it's the thinnest rubber coating I've ever seen. If I ordered this with the intention of not using it with a case and having a grippy rear cover, I'd be pretty upset. Really, for my own purposes this is a 5 star product, but I think if I didn't have this narrow use-case, I'd have called it 4 stars. So there ya go.",1,1,0.9828457917893535

The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.

"This is a good dog-seat solution.

PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fits perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper straps are attached to the frame halfway along the side walls and not at the very front means that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in).  The clip attaches to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable.

CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog falls against the side of the box or wants to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clips onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply comes out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

TIP: The floor does occasionally tip back, especially if the car seatback to which it is attached is tilted back slightly. The more upright you make the back of the car seat, the better the box hangs horizontally.",1,1,0.9479184164157655

"""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is the last of Coelho's trilogy that explores the parameters of Good and Evil and their impact on the human soul.  In this story a stranger, battered and disheartened by the absolute worse that life can dish out, visits a small town with the intentions of carrying out an experiment aimed at assuaging some of his bitterness and pain.  While in the village, he enlists the help of Miss Prym who, bored with small town living, sees an opportunity for escape; but at what cost?  As the story unfolds the people of Viscos learn of the experiment and how they, collectively and individually, can benefit from it.  It is Coelho's interrogation of the villagers' intentions that provides the reader with a glimpse of the dueling forces of good and evil.

The novel is very well translated as I never felt that something was missing while reading it.  The language is loaded with meaning and highly symbolic.  ""Viscos is just like any other village in the world and whatever happens there happens in every continent, city, camp, convent, wherever.""  This is the wisdom shared with Miss Prym by Berta, the village's aged sage who spends her days watching over the village in an effort to see any evil coming.  I've always enjoyed Coelho's work and ""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is no different.  This is a solid story that's easily read and internalized.  Ultimately, what we learn about good and evil from this text sounds a lot simpler than I expected and much more easily articulated than done.  This is a quick yet profound read.  Highly Recommended.",1,1,0.9591627863356862

I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash.

"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:
- Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James.",1,1,0.9799228552070911

"This light really packs the punch. The wide beam is good enough to make a small room look like a room. The dimmer feature is also great, if you don't mind having a dimmer. It's not a large beam, but it is very bright. If you have a large room, it's a great option. The light is very well built and well made. I wish I had known about it before I bought it.It's an old fashioned, classy, and pretty. I love it. The color is a little too warm for my tastes.

"These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.",1,1,0.9822822936928223

"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy.
The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces.
Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there.
These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.

I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?

But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far.
I am hoping they make a 3.0 version with a  heavier base and no areas where kibble pieces can get stuck.",1,1,0.9595504767951915

"The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic story about what happens to a foolish puppet who does not listen to the wise advice of others and who disobeys his unselfish father Geppetto.  From the moment he comes to life Pinocchio causes trouble.  He chooses not to listen to the Talking Cricket, a black-bird, a Parrot, and a Fairy with blue hair.  Pinocchio encounters a (supposedly) lame Fox and a (supposedly) blind Cat who dupe him into putting money in the (alleged) Field of Riches.  After skipping school Pinocchio narrowly escapes a vicious police dog and a hungry green fisherman.  Pinocchio becomes a donkey (Collodi makes good use of symbolism here!) as a result of his visit to Funville.  The donkey becomes lame after tripping in a circus act.  A man comes along to purchase the lame donkey so the animal's skin can be used to make a drum.  After being thrown into the sea with a stone around his neck the donkey changes back into a puppet.  Pinocchio is then swallowed by a shark and discovers that his father has suffered the same fate.  Father and son both escape and Pinocchio becomes a real boy.

The moral of this story is fairly clear: Our bad decisions and foolish choices have negative consequences.  Though this story is targeted to children (boys in particular) the lessons presented in this book can apply to adults as well.  The version of this story in this review is an adaption and is designed for younger readers.  However, adults will enjoy this wonderful story about a classic literary character and the error of his ways.

I love a book that starts with the most beautiful idea and then lets you think about how you could accomplish it. This book is a must read for any creative mind. This book will help you to achieve your goal.,0,0,0.05820755481104229

"Cute idea and set up but the manufacturers packaging really stinks which just ruined it for me! Drum sticks and stand were tossed in loose around the actual drums that were wedged into cheap, flimsy plastic packaging. Drum sticks arrived extremely bent, to the point where it's awkward to actually hit them on the drums, which is a bummer because we bought this as a cheap starter set for our daughters birthday and now we have to hunt for new sticks so she can even play it before we can give it to her.",1,1,0.9906090931661673
"OK right off I am happy with the quality and quality of the product.  I have one other product that I had to replace, but that is the one that I have now.  I have had no issues with the product, and it is going well.  I would definitely buy again.I love these lights!  I have had them for a few years now and they are awesome.  I have tried to keep them on my truck because of the size of the light, but they are too small for the light.  I am very happy with them!I bought this for my wife and her husband for Christmas and they love it. They have a lot of options, but I like the fact that I can change them for different times and brands. I also like the fact that they have a little LED light that is brighter than my old incandescent bulbs. I love the fact that the light is not so bright as a incandescent bulb.

"I needed a larger tea kettle and liked the looks of this one. I was changing for another reason also, that the handle became very hot when it was used so I was hoping for a handle that remained cooler.

"Our home has well water service and we only get about 40-45psi of water pressure.  A typical shower head gives a pretty unsatisfying experience with such mediocre pressure.  So I bought this on the hope that things would be a little better.

WOW!  I'm not sure how it works, but the end result is the feeling of significantly more pressure and a much wider and more powerful dispersal of water.  I'm going to buy additional units for the other showers in the house.",1,1,0.8668922869209396
"I bought this to control a basement dehumidifier.  I mounted it in an electrical box with a receptacle and plug my dehumidifier into it.  It seems to work well.  Turning the knob all the way CCW is OFF and all the way CW is ON with markings from 80 to 20 in between.  I have mine set at about 52, which seems to keep the humidity in my basement around 60 percent.  I would say the markings are approximate so it's best to have a separate inexpensive humidity monitor so you know the humidity level is where you want it.  I used a 2 gang electrical box but a 3 gang would have been a better fit as this device is much wider than a switch or receptacle so I had to trim the cover to make everything fit.  This would have been avoided with the wider box.",1,1,0.8940793894108472

"THOUGHTS:

Audrey Carlan shows us her true colors and the ways in which she fights for her beliefs.

I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed every minute of it.

I think this is a good book for young adult readers.

It gives us a glimpse of a woman who is taking the steps to become a better person.

It also shows us a woman who will fight for her beliefs and win.

I loved the way this book showed us that we can be a better person.

I am not going to put it down.

I really enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading more from this author",0,0,0.4232396109046421
