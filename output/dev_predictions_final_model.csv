"This emotionally packed romance had me laughing out loud one moment and crying the next!  The characters are honest, real and very refreshing.  A story about real life troubles in the peerage and the way real people get through them.  While the rules of English edict control,  Bryce writes without all the silly debutante drama found in many historical romances, without shallow characters that can never make up their minds and without pages and pages of explicit love scenes.

"I have two miniature pinchers who will be 2 YO in Sept 2014.  I got them in December of 2012; they were about 12 weeks.  That first Winter one of the pups had a bad back knee that tended to go out when she put pressure on it. When it did it obviously hurt, since she gave out a yelp..  So, she decided to stop climbing stairs.  Thinking she might need ACL surgery, I took her to a vet well known for that.  He said, nope not her ligament: bad joint (thin collagen). And he said it was a breed characteristic.  He prescribed this supplement.  Took care of it pretty quick and soon she was bounding up and down the stairs, jumping on and off the sofa and when she was tall enough, my bed.  Since the vet said bad knees are a breed characteristic, I have both dogs on a half pill a day.  The pain went away fairly quick, maybe a couple of weeks.  I keep them on it hoping to stave off arthritis in their later years.  And, best of all, they think it is a treat!  UPDATE:  As of Jan 2015 both girls no longer pups are still doing great.

"**3.5 stars**

I have a thing for time travel books. It started when I was a kid with A Wrinkle in Time and has continued throughout my adult life. I've read Outlander multiple times and practically hug it at night. I just find time travel love stories to unbearably romantic.

""Paradox Lost"" was a nicely done time travel story with some good romantic chemistry. I always enjoy Libby Drew's writing. She writes in a way that feels... easy. Her stories have a great flow to them and this one was no exception. I was hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book.

I had a few problems with some of the finer details of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and was supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it was irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic facts about the era that he was visiting. He kept trying to open things voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when things were invented.

Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 years and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that.

I tend to think of all of these details when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies.

Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day. A solid 3.5 star (aka between ""liked"" and ""really liked"") for me.

"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.

"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set.",1,1,0.9783379755234075

"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book.",1,1,0.9709250108145145

"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly.

If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory.

I was surprised when I started the book that it is NOT like the Orson Wells version of radio and movie fame. This is set in England at the end of the 19th century. This definitely limits the defensive abilities of the Earthlings compared to the movie. It is also part of what makes it interesting, because the Martians react much differently than the movie version as well. They are slower, more definite in their movements, and more connected between landing spots. Also, there are only ten landing spots for the Martians, it seems, rather than the world-wide invasion of the movie version. In fact, one area that left me questioning was what the rest of the world was doing while this went on in southern England?

The sample section of the book ""The Map of the Sky"" should have been left out, in my opinion. It was pompous and self-important, and was not in any way enjoyable, nor did it succeed in making me want to read a book that obviously was merely a ""tag-along"" story with little interest of its own.

The writing style was excellent, fast-moving overall though not without some hefty explanation sections. Grammar, spelling, word use, all are what one would expect from a consummate professional. I held off reading this book for quite a while after I downloaded it, in the fear that it would be another disappointing ""classic"". It was nothing of the sort; it is an excellent book of early science fiction, and a very enjoyable read.",1,1,0.9723582915970933

Then when we do get some action it seems to be written in such a way as to not worry or Frighten the youngest of readers.  At the very end  it got more  interesting to build up to the next book.

"I really loved reading this book.  I became  immersed in a foreign culture very dissimilar to mine in many of its strict gender behavior and religious expectations but, at the same time, composed of very human, very plausible characters with whom I could empathize.  Slowly getting to know the characters, piecing them together, and wondering who were the good and bad guys, all had me on the edge of my chair wanting to know more.  Particularly fascinating were the female characters and how each dealt with the constraints placed upon them in a society where a woman's sexuality is such a preoccupation that it has to be hidden and controlled, and where the males do not seem to generally take responsibility to control their own (although one of the main male characters was very sensitive to these issues and torn by guilt and angst by his own self-perceived transgressions against the true spirituality of Islam, and his desire to treat the woman he wanted with the highest regard).  Meeting strong women who wanted to develop themselves professionally in a male-dominated culture that generally blocked that from happening was refreshing and touched my heart.  I applauded them and those males who supported them, wishing to truly respect their intelligence and not exploit  or demean them (although there were those who did).  All of the characters were unique and very engaging, with the no-nonsense, dedicated and very wise investigator, Osama Ibrahim (was the name, Osama, chosen deliberately, to create a more balanced association with it?), being my favorite.  Also extremely fascinating was gaining entre into the desert environment, and modern man's attempt to master it and treat it as a wilderness adventure.  I highly recommend this mystery novel, one that stands out in a genre that has no short supply of reading choices.",1,1,0.9876630676964749

"There is little doubt that Trevor is a master of his craft and perhaps the  greatest living short story writer in the world today.  After Rain, a  volume of twelve stories, explores such subjects as infidelity,  homosexuality, religious conflicts, and violence.  What makes these stories  so powerful, however, is not the subjects they deal with, but the portrayal  of the characters thoughts, emotions, and responses.  Trevor is able to  examine such human conditions as jealousy, rage, sadness, regret, and hope  in a non-judgmental light that leaves the reader looking into oneself to  gain further insight.  His writing style is nothing short of remarkable.  He is eloquent and simplistic, never revealing more than he should, making  the unspoken a compelling component of his story.  If you have not yet read  Trevor, I urge you to wait no longer.  His literary grace will surely leave  a lasting impact on you as a reader and as a human being.",1,1,0.9841251383048785

I could not put this book down. I devoured it in a matter of an hour and a little bit, and it blew my mind. Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel.

"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.

"Needed something exactly like this!!  I love the feel and fit of this bag.  I'm 5'10"" and it fits perfectly.  The bag itself is a great size and fits nicely.  It's a good size for a backpack.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made well. I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid. The gun is well made and seems to be well made. The gun is very bright and bright. It's not bright, but the gun does have a very bright field of view.

"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

"I have always wanted one of these, and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two I had were the Schlage and the Porter Cable, so it is a nice quality product.  It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

"A First Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links between Leadrship and Mental Illness is a book you might want to read.  Some will find the historical illustrations thin while others may find the analysis provided a stretch in place, but Nassiar Ghaemi has published one interesting book.  Ghaemi is the director of the Mood Disorder Program at Tuft Medical School.  Using available historical and medical evidence, he argues that various mood disorders can be  linked to success in leadership situations.  In individual sections he takes up creativity, realism, empathy, and resilience.  He finally takes up treatment and mental in general.  Along the way, he illustrates his views using the lives of well known persons including Bush, Blair, Nixon, JFK, Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Lincoln Churchill.  Just the character sketches that Ghaemi uses is worth the price of the book.  This is one of the more thought provoking books that I have read in the past couple of years.

I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.

"Spoilers: Not since Alien 3 has a movie with a third act gone wrong that a movie with a third act gone wrong had a movie with a third act gone wrong.  The result is that it's a little disappointing.  Some of the movie's dialogue and plot holes are almost laughable.  The only redeeming feature is the soundtrack.  There's a lot of music, but it's just not there.  I can't tell you how many times I've been so confused that I thought I'd never heard the music.  I know that I haven't.

"""Ordinary Men"" chronicles the rise and fall of Reserve Police Battalion 101, one of several units that took part in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question while in Poland. During the course of their stay, they were responsible for the shooting of 38,000 Jews, while also deporting 45,200 to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. The book argues that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and other units like it, were comprised of ordinary men. It begs the question: How did ordinary men become the cold-blooded killers of the Holocaust?

Author Christopher R. Browning does a tremendous job of covering the ground. He also presents a strong case that these people were indeed ordinary men, who came from ordinary backgrounds, only to end up being transformed into the murderers of thousands. However, the book also stresses that some of the men, including several officers, could not be considered ""ordinary,"" as they were trained in Hitler's Nazi organizations from youth. Browning also does something nearly impossible: He humanizes these people without excusing their horrendous actions. Their defense that ""they were just following orders"" just doesn't fit the bill, as some refused to take part in the actions, and asked to be relieved. If a few men could get themselves relieved from doing the killings, why did so many more not? That is the main question the book gives. ""Ordinary Men"" is an extraordinary book that chronicles just one unit that took part in the murder of innocent Jews, while also presenting a good case of how ordinary men can become killers. I highly recommend this book to all students of the Holocaust.",1,1,0.9205287872727653

I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit too small for a laptop. The keyboard is small, and it's not in the same position as a regular laptop keyboard.

"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device.",1,1,0.9464944978711359

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down.",1,1,0.9919350722614133

"I found this short history tedious.  I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer histories I've read in the past.

I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many characters in the space without rounding the characters out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personalities and not enough color given to their backgrounds.  I feel the author's past as a journalist has influenced her here.  She can write volumes of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.

I enjoy Christopher Hibbert and Alison Weir more.  They convey complex historical events with a gift for giving the reader a feeling for the time and they have an ability to communicate characters on more of a flesh-and-blood level.  Too bad.

"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that.",1,1,0.9975497230843319

"If you have read the book, you know the basic gist of it, and the reader will understand what's going on in the story.  The basic idea is to take the reader on a journey into the world of the mind, and then read it with an open mind.  In other words, the reader is going to get a glimpse into the mind of a person who is not a psychologist or a psychiatrist.  The book is very useful, and a good introduction to the subject.  I highly recommend it, and recommend it highly, if you haven't already.

"I was using a mechanical keyboard that made me have to type at an angle, and the keys had some resistance going down. I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain. Fearing it might be carpal tunnel, I ended up doing a bunch of hand stretches, and also replaced by keyboard with the amazon basics keyboard I was using before. I think the stretches helped fix damage that was done, and using the keyboard prevented any further damage from building up. My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people.",1,1,0.9829774409352197

"It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park."" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny ""insipid""!

This umbrella was very difficult to open and then just as difficult to fold back down. It feels as if after a few openings and closings it will break because of having to forse it to open.  I will not close down to the original size therefore it is a strain to wrap the band around it when it is in the folded closed position.  It will not fit back into its case.

"I pitched this fun device as a drone to my son, who thought it was the best thing in the world.  We took it to the local soccer field and we were off! Or rather, we were off to a wobbly start.

The Jump Jet is technically a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle, capable of rising and descending like a helicopter and buzzing around in the air like a plane.  We liken it to Windblade, the Autobot who transforms into a VTOL jet.

The Jump Jet looks like a jet but it takes off like a helicopter, which means it ascends by drifting backward and then launching upward.  It takes some maneuvering to get this right, as it's not one helicopter blade over the center but two blades, which causes the drift.  There's even a control to adjust for this drift, but good luck using those while you're trying to get the Jump Jet to take off.

Once it takes off, there's another button to transform it (see?) into jet mode.  I was torn between shouting ""Form of...a JET!"" and making that sound Transformers make when they do it, but my kids were already nervous about flying this thing in public so I decided to keep their embarrassment to a minimum.

The transformation to jet comes suddenly, which requires a completely different set of flying skills.  Where before I was simply trying to keep the thing from crashing into the ground or to a child, now it's a matter of keeping it aloft and moving forward.

I took me several tries to get the Jump Jet to take off, transform into jet mode, fly around, and then transform back into helicopter mode to land.  By the time I finally managed it, it was out of power.

My eight-year-old tried this several times and was never able to get it, but he was very helpful in running all over creation to bring it back from the latest crash landing.",1,1,0.9871358051151333

But it seemed like LB would appeal to those same readers.
So I quickly bought LB as soon as I saw the hype begin. It was a wondeful first novel by a talented writer. Her heaven sounds good enough to me that I might have to reconsider my whole ""heaven"" thing. Besides, she put dogs in her heaven so the book got an automatic 3 stars just for that.
Susie, the murdered girl narrator is believable and without a shred of self pity or angst. Her story unfolds much like you would expect it to as she describes the aftermath of disaster. I loved the grandma, was puzzled by the mother and thought she captured the sister, brother and murderer very well. I was glad she didn't go into any kind of poor murderer he had a terrible life, thing. Ya gotta figure he did. And I'm glad she stuck it to him in the end...
She really captured my interest with her portrayal of the father and I was touched by his travels through grief, despair, revenge and losses...

Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my experience is that the Tidy Cat clumping litter has more dust then the Tidy Cat lightweight litter, and tracks less.  My cats don't show a preference from one over the other, but lugging around 35 lb buckets is making me make a preference.  This lightweight litter actually seems to clump harder.  And when you have to scoop through 3-4"" of litter to remove the clumps, the lightweight litter makes a big difference.

"This disk is one of my favorites. Although not quite up to the standards of it's two predecessors, the Third Dr. Mabuse film (and the last directed by Lang himself) is wonderful and more than worth the purchase price.
David Kalat's extraordinary commentary is easily THE BEST I have ever heard (and I've heard quite a few.) He strikes the perfect balance between knowledge and wit - the narration is informative without being dry or condescending and, indeed, is quite lively at times. His delivery style is remarkably excellent throughout and is a major reason I consider the disk to be one of my most valued.
Two tiny quibbles, stuff so small as to bother only me: The English Language captioning, written for the German audio track, is a little disorienting when viewed in connection with the English language track. Most of this has to do with the demands of lip-synchronization between two languages. Still, and despite the additional cost it might have created, two independent sets of captions would have been appreciated - one for each of the different languages. This would be a welcome addition for a hearing impared viewer.
The other minor quibble is that the documentary really needed captioning, much more so than the feature owing to the heavy accented speech.
All told, though, this is absolutely a remarkable film and a remarkable, and very treasured disk. AllDay Entertainment is releasing some extraordinary stuff, and deserve kudos and, above all, purchases!",1,1,0.9848647222924433

"The Fulcrum 30030-308 wireless remote LED light is a simple and effective way to add light to a room or a closet that doesn't already have a light and a light switch. It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

Bottom line, this works and I'm mostly happy with it, but I'd be even happier if the light fixture was ""flatter"" from front to back and the remote light switch was smaller.",1,1,0.9627753635198637

"Seven-year-old Eric has always had an active imagination and a fascination with snow and cold weather. Initially, his father Ben doesn't think that his son's talk of a magical kingdom known as Lukana is anything more than a little boy's typical childhood imagination. Ben, himself, prefers the summer, while his late wife Jamie - Eric's mother - loved the winter. Jamie died giving birth to Eric, but her final act in life was to apologize to Ben.

Ben never knew exactly why Jamie apologized to him, although he vowed to himself that as his son grew, Eric would always be loved. Then, one winter day, Eric sculpts a snow owl in the backyard. With such a simple and childish act, Eric unwittingly sets in motion a series of events that cannot possibly be anything but magical. Now Ben faces the terrifying prospect of losing his only child to a wintry spirit...a spirit that just might be the boy's true father.

"If you are interested in learning what happens at sea when boredom, monotony, ennui  and endless accounts of filler material taken from every one of the good, action packed adventures that began this series then this is the book for you. I happen to like learning what a day may have looked like at sea in that era but not to the extent that it is all that we learn about over all the pages except the last thirty when the action begins but is broken with an abrupt ending. Of course the action resumes where it left off at the beginning of the next book. In what is rapidly becoming a dissatisfying series, this is the supreme example of dissatisfaction up to this point in my opinion. As usual, I cant fault the writing but the point of this story seems to have been to sell one more book no matter the consequences of not providing an entertaining story. When I first read this series I thought every one of them was a masterpiece of naval historical work. Now that Ive been hooked by the genre, I can say many more recent writers have exceeded these last few books in story telling quality. Two that immediately come to mind are Dewey Lambdin and Jay Worrell. From the same timeframe when OBrian was writing, I value Dudley Popes work more highly. Considering my lack of memory of what the rest of the series holds I hope my opinion of these last few books is dispelled by those remaining.

First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.

"I really thought this game looked silly at first - but once I got to playing it, it's amazingly fun! You get All Three new Episodes of the movies with this game!

The little lego guys are absolutely adorable, and when ships blow up, they disintegrate into their component lego parts. Lego fans will be thrilled to see little lego flowers, lego swinging doors, and much more. The game is pretty true to the story line, which is funny in and of itself, watching the famous Star Wars scene done lego-style. You jump, shoot and light-saber your way through the scenes. You get to use a variety of characters, and each character of course has his or her own special talents. There's a lot of coin-collecting, secret-finding and bad guy bashing. There's an optional two player mode which is great - someone else can grab a controller, play for a while, then drop out without any penalty at all. There's a regular story mode for going through the movie plotline, plus a free play where you can randomly switch between various players to solve some of the trickier puzzles. There's a good deal of replayability as you go back searching for the treasures, and trying to unlock all of the cool extra features. This is really perfect for the munchkins, but adults may find themselves playing it after the little ones are asleep because it's actually rather fun.

The movie takes place in the future where the Alien is sent to Earth. This is a far cry from the first movie. The movie is the most realistic movie I have seen on the Alien franchise. I will say that the acting is not bad. The movie is very realistic and a good way to show that the Alien is real. The alien is a very scary creature that is not scary at all. There is a scene where the Alien is said to be a ""little kid"". The movie is filled with references to other movies and to a horror movie. It is a scary movie to see how it is made. I wish there were more movies like this on the DVD. I will say that the movies are not bad. I recommend that you buy the movie. I recommend that you watch this movie.

"Having read and thoroughly enjoying Bernstein's earlier biography of Thomas Jefferson, I decided to give THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS, a look. Like his earlier work, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson, however this book is geared towards the school age reader. Much of the text is identical to the earlier biography. The most significant difference is the addition of dozens of illustrations, from portraits of Jefferson's friends, family, and foes, and political cartoons. My single knock on Bernstein's book is the same knock I had on his previous work. Bernstein adamantly portrays Jefferson as a ""strict separationist"", which in and of itself is accurate. However he fails to recognize that what constituted a ""strict separationist"" 200 years ago is much different than the definition given in today's climate of political correctness gone awry. Bernstein seems genuinely perplexed that Jefferson ""sent Christian missionaries to establish schools in western territories to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity. "" As with extremists today, Bernstein fails to understand that Jefferson's actions did not violate the First Amendment in that ""Congress made no law respecting the establishment of religion. ""

I could spend all day writing about how mixed up people are about what the First Amendment means and how it was intended by our framers, but that strays from the subject at hand. All in all, this is a great introduction for school children and should capture their interest and perhaps, lead them into more indepth study of one of our greatest leaders. Monty Rainey

But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.",1,1,0.982024478471105

"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.",1,1,0.9924490815887063

"I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.",1,1,0.9520175207063459

"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had to laugh at the antics of the main character, Aiden, to woo Katie over. He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.

"Short, Sexy and Steamy&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K.  MY THREE FAVORITE COLORS!

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

"Marion Myles has an incredible talent for drawing raw emotion from the reader and giving an almost preternatural insight into the emotional state of her characters, to the point that you as the reader are living those emotions.  Mental illness is a terrible and sad fact of life, and the ripple effects on the people around someone who suffers from a mental illness can be devastating in the extreme.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire.",1,1,0.901632343692292

"My 5 year old and my 3 year old really enjoyed the DohVinci Deluxe Styler.  They played with it back and forth between them for around an hour. There was a little bit of fighting over who's turn it was so you know they liked using it.

The Play-Doh that comes out of the tubes is not traditional Play-Doh. It's a softer compound making it easy enough for kids to squeeze. The Styler gun is simple to use; the kids didn't need any help changing it out. My 3 year old was able to do it a couple of times, but couldn't after his hands were reportedly ""wet"". I'm not sure if he had been putting his fingers in his or just clammy kid hands. I don't know why, sometimes kids just got clammy hands, they don't know either. Anyway aside from ""wet"" hands the kids were able to completely utilize the DohVinci Styler.

Another point about it not being traditional Play-Doh is that it's not reusable. When you finished with regular Play-Doh the kids clean it up by putting it back in the container it came in for use another day. This DohVinci Play-Doh is a one shot deal. It has to be thought of as more of an Art project medium than regular Play-Doh.",1,1,0.8947803420147445

"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.

It is comfortable in my hands, sits on the counter in a stable fashion when I am scraping the bowl, and ejects the beaters easily.  However it is not meant for heavy tasks - for that I have a KitchenAid stand mixer (of course).  So I gave it a 4 only because it is not really powerful.",1,1,0.9736426331989753

"This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.

The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned. All in all I'm pleased, other than the fact that my Earth Brown turned out to be Dark Brown, a color not even listed as an option by Amazon.

"Growing up, there are certain stories that you are told are classics.  Your parents have read them, your teachers suggest them and all the critics continually laud them.  `The Swiss Family Robinson' is one of those books.  Just the very title causes one to take notice, and if you have ever read the book or happened to see the Disney film, you are taken to a lovely place of nostalgia whenever someone mentions it.

The great thing about books like this one is that these stories and the way they are shaped, molded and ultimately told are timeless.  Any age, sex or domination can and will enjoy this.  There are so many themes broached, but in a beautiful package that never feels overwhelming or too stuffed.  Everything feels relaxed and natural.  It is also a testament to real storytelling that the novel remains exciting and intriguing no matter how familiar you are with the story.  Settling in this past month to read this to my kids was a great way to relive the beauty and grace of this novel, watching it captivate them as well as me (new ears and old).

The language is fluid (which is not always so in these older classics) and the action is always present, even during seeming mundane situations.  My children were always intrigued, and I loved plowing through the chapters with them.  The lush imagery presented by Wyss is unforgettable and really a notch above most of what we have to read today.  There is truth in the idea that one cannot beat a classic, and `The Swiss Family Robinson' is a classic for a reason.",1,1,0.9793393699110845

The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts.

In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.  And if you want old school writing by a woman who was contemporary with the whole WWI era, Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series are usuaaly in print.",1,1,0.934596255379871
"My son is 3 and he absolutely loved these puzzles!  He plays with it for at least 20 minutes at a time, dumping all of the pieces together and then putting each puzzle together separately.  He rarely even needs to ask for help.

"Nice fit, but mine wore out in less than 2 months of use!  I use these just over 2x per week. Already, the glove material is separating and flaking off from the hand pads.  See photos.  Now, I had a pair of bicycle gloves that lasted me over 1 year doing the same workout as these for my weight training regime.  When my bike gloves finally kicked the bucket, I thought, I guess I should have purchased weight training gloves to use for weight training. My next set was Champion C9 weight training gloves, which separated at the seem after about 4 months.  I attributed that to the low cost/low quality and decided to upgrade to the more expensive GoFit gloves.  Nope, these things came apart in less than 2 months of use, worst return yet...and most expensive!! Go figure.",1,1,0.9952513183624568

"You know what I loved about this book?  I never had to forgive the hero or the heroine for being an idiot.  Not once did they betray each other. Not once did they fail to forgive a shortcoming.  There was no subterfuge, no great misunderstanding.  It's just a story of a man, trying to win a woman's heart --and succeeding.

Margaret is firmly on the shelf at 30 when her brother inherits a Dukedom.  He decides to share his good fortune with his sister, offering a sizable dowry for her to finally snag a husband.  That money is just what Rhys needs.  But when he meets Margaret, he is taken with her quick wit and strong will... and he knows they would be a perfect fit.

Margaret wants a man to love her for more than the money her brother is offering.  And Rhys' financial problems are no secret, so it takes some time before she is assured of his affections.  But the sexual tension is good and when they finally come together, it's great.  There are a few foils for the couple along the way, but they're all external.  It's a short read... only a little over 100 pages... but a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  4 stars.",1,1,0.942275941422394
"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.
Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.  And unlike Joe Levine, none of US owned the screen rights to THE CARPETBAGGERS . . .",1,1,0.9894170843415554

"Because this movie was made by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia, Romeo+Juliet), I had high expectations. And a lot of those expectations were met: beautiful cinematography, a good amount of music, a nice tragic love story, over-the-top but well-done drama. Unfortunately though, it got pretty slow towards the end, and the music wasn't nearly as integrated as it could (and I think should) have been.  I'm not sure an entire song was ever played through, and it wasn't nearly as important to the plot of the movie as it was, for example, in Moulin Rouge. I was disappointed.

"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled.

"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint.",1,1,0.9798511503243262

"This is truly a fantastic little class d amp with good clarity and enough punch to drive a few bass notes.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

"Laurel Hawthorne is a woman with secrets, which she believed she'd left behind when she married David and moved into a posh gated community. Until, that is, the night that their daughter's friend drowned in the Hawthornes' pool, a terrible event that put a huge crack in Laurel's carefully maintained facade. The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a riveting, Southern gothic, family drama, driven by the skeletons in Laurel's closet, her fear for her own daughter, and her love-hate relationship with her glamorous older sister, Thalia. Did someone cause Mollie's drowning? Was it an accident or a murder? What does daughter Shelby know that she isn't telling? Does David have a mistress? Do ghosts really appear to Laurel? And, underlying all these foreboding questions is an even darker one, about a death that occurred during her childhood.

"This brilliant debut album by the late, great guitar legend is also one of the best albums of all time and you'll see this album in the top half of practically every top 100 lists of best albums and for very good reason too.  Released in 1967, the year of The Beatles' ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band"" this rock hard power trio combo was unlike anything that anyone had ever heard before except perhaps Pete Townsend's The Who and Eric Clapton's Cream but the influence was immense and rock music was never the same again.  No weak tracks on this album and every track is brilliant here with no fillers in sight.  This version of this seminal album is also the best one that's out there at present.  The sound quality has been remastered very, very well and the mini-lp replica cardboard packaging is a work of art too.  We get two bonus tracks albeit in mono: ""Highway Chile"" and ""51st Anniversary"" but all 17 tracks are simply gems and classic rock standards.  We get a 24 page colour booklet with all the lyrics plus great liner notes about the band plus another booklet which contains the lyrics in Japanese as well.  For fans and students of great classic rock as well as aspiring rock guitarists out there, this, indeed all Jimi's albums are required listening.

"I went with the 30 minn kota for my 14 ft flat bottom, trying to save a little money. The small motor does decent.... your not going anywhere in a hurry, lol. Also, if it is pretty windy, you are going to struggle, I took this motor to land between the lakes, and tried to use it to move around the main banks on a very windy ""white cap day""...... it worked okay. if your trying to move towards the direction the wind is coming from, you may have some issues. I have used this little motor on 3 different boats, my 14 ft flat bottom, a 12 ft flat bottom we rented (10HP max lake), and a 10 ft v bottom. It works about the same on all 3, the small 10 footer is a heavy boat, maybe even heavier than my 14 ft.

Bottom line, it will do the job. It will move you around coves, or even across small, not so windy channels. BUT.... if you can afford to spend another 65 bucks, just buy the 40 LBS, I can promise you, you will be happier with it. Not saying Im not happy with this small motor, but I do wish I had the extra 10 ft LBS for windy days, or rivers with a swifter current. If you cant afford the other one, or refuse to wait any longer and saye up (like I did.... lol, couldn't wait), buy this one. Like I said, small boats, calm lake, you will get around pretty good.

"no more rusty rake! this little kit is a must have for any scoopfree box! i've been using it for a month and cleaned it for the first time this morning. the dirt wipes off easily like butter (excuse the image. :P). the reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because i just encountered a problem this weekend. when i installed the rake a month ago, i noticed the two 'ears' if you will, were slightly scraping the side of the box. it wasn't an issue at the beginning until i realized this past weekend, instead of raking the box with the bottom of the tines pointing forward, the rake is raking with the top of the tines pointing forward, which completely defeated the purpose of the box. i'm guessing the box was giving the rake a counter-force at the 'ears' where they are scratching each other. it made the rake move harder. i was able to fix it in about 15mins. here's how:
1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.",1,1,0.9210986732002864

The four corner speakers are 8 Watts each. Don't let the ""150W"" fool you. The center speaker's qualitty reminds me of a pocket radio's speaker. It's very mid-range only and there's almost no tonal quality to voices.
The cables should be longer. I'm going to have to make extensions for my application. That's not hard since the speakers, except for the front right, are RCA. I believe a 9-pin D-SUB extension cable will work for the front right speaker but I'm not sure yet.

"I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...

4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies.",1,1,0.9405138141519684

"In comedy, TIMING IS EVERYTHING.  Subject knowledge comes in a close second.
George Burns' decades of entertainment experience allowed him to master both both aspects of comedy.  Whether working alone or with a partner (Gracie Allen, Walter Matthau, Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Fred Astaire, Brooke Shields, etc...) George often slipped bits of wisdom in with his punch lines.  Sometimes those were the punch lines.  I could say he was at his best with this collection of TV Specials, but the truth is he was at his best each decade since he partnered with Gracie in 1923.  We can only be thankful George continued working after Gracie's passing in 1964.

"We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!",1,1,0.9495856840468816

"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!

Get this set and let Bette Davis show what great acting is.",1,1,0.9652530465879106

"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it.",1,1,0.9909844249661729
"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.

"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others.",1,1,0.9803526353324563

"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.",1,1,0.9773908168673913

"Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

"My 12 year old sheltie has bad hips, which I guess is common for his age and breed.  Before a vet recommended this product, we were helping our dog stand up after laying down for too long, and my husband had to carry him up and down stairs in order to go outside.  This was three years ago, and I was sure it was about time to put him down.  He's a little slow going up and down stairs, but he does it on his own now.  He gets up and down on his own and follows me around just like he did when he was a puppy.  He's a happy dog and still as loveable as always.  If we accidentally run out of Nutramax Cosequin DS, he starts to limp and slow down within a week.  This has truly been amazing ..

"Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did.",1,1,0.974026847575643

"Great cheap pots. Dishwasher safe (no nasty exterior coating like other pots) Good nonstick interior all the way to the rim. Doesn't chip easily. I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

"Author, Tim Nolen, captures the genre of superhero literature and then puts a humorous twist on it. His wonderfully thought out band of underdogs manage to battle their way from one encounter to the next on their way to stopping the evil plans of Blackheart, the story's main antagonist, using team work and creative use of their limited super powers. Nolen's creations were true to the usual superhero tropes we've come to expect from superhero fiction, but they don't come off as dry or unbelievable. Of course, the human elements of our heroes.. mainly the back and forth banter, gallows humor, and even sexual under currents, add to the story without distracting the reader.

"This is the most beautiful mini-series you're liable to see. A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

The fairy tales return to their roots with this mature- yet decent enough for people of all ages- fantasy. It's simply beautiful.",1,1,0.9816382714569307
"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.",1,1,0.9606202691319121

"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company.

"I like and admire cats, but I'm a dog person. And I've never been fond of cleaning up after indoor cats. We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!",1,1,0.9536088542316489

"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing.

I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt.

"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again.",1,1,0.9832837968008786

The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.

I had a friend who was a dog trainer and wanted to take her on a walk and had her harness in the trunk of the car. This was an excellent choice.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a dog with a big head or neck and wants to work on their head.

I have a 14lb lab mix and I like this harness to allow her to walk with ease. It is a bit awkward to put on, but it is sturdy enough to allow her to stretch out while walking. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a dog with a very large head or neck.

"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle.

I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.,1,1,0.9838071500713019

"After viewing these 4 films once again, I realize how important some twentieth century films are to our understanding of ourselves, our religons, the way we love one another, and the way we deal with death. The artistry is within every frame. There is one interview documentry with Bergman in 1998 with one of his assocites, it is clear that as Bergman got older and older, he wanted to dis-associate himself from these early acheivements. Why? He states that although he knew he was master of the medium (and theater as well)that his personal life, was just a series of bitter disappointments ending with the death of his last wife, Ingrid I beleive. So, he assumed himself to be just an anonymous technician, or at least that's what he wished. The only compliant I have is that the subtitles are inside of the visual image instead of being letter boxed and the subtitles are sloppily inserted. Not up to Criterion criteria. One new observation is that the ensamble cast that Bergman uses throughout most of these films are one of the reasons these movies are the classics that they are. Lastly, Bergman films aren't made to be watched once and discarded, they are made to be re-inestigated year-in and year-out.",1,1,0.9825946561386425

"I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.

"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it.",1,1,0.973481799953651

This was a very intriguing story and Michael Mann's direction was spot on. There are a lot of Miami Vice influences in the colors and the way it was shot.

"A standalone read with a HEA, no cliffhanger.  Denton works for his father as an enforcer on collecting money owed.  He also is a CEO of his own business.  He helped out a friend, Kara, by hiring her to be his PA.  Kara is killed and he is hellbent on getting revenge on her killer(s), whoever they are.

Chloe is a newly graduated FBI agent working her first undercover case.  She comes in as a replacement for Kara as Denton's PA.  She is all for bringing Denton and his father down and arresting them, especially since her father was on the bad side of a loan shark.

What Chloe didn't count on was falling for Denton.  Denton doesn't want to fall for Chloe but he does as well.

Overall I really enjoyed the story, but when Denton finds out the Chloe was an FBI agent and was set on bringing him down, I found it almost hard to believe that he forgave her that easily.  I mean he beat up his friend on his father's orders but forgave Chloe for being an FBI agent almost immediately.  Liked the little plot twist towards the end (no spoilers).

I would recommend this as a quick read.  The characters were thought out and the story flowed well.

"This book is at times cute, at times witty, and at times heartbreaking.  The story of two aimless brothers and their boring, pointless lives in Reno, ""Motel Life"" is a solid read.  Tragedy sets the two brothers on a road trip together, but this is no buddy story about bonding while traveling.  It is one character's realization that his life is going nowhere and that he needs to find a way to change that before he gets to the point where his rut is inevitable.  Along the way, his brother is going through a journey of his own, full of guilt and fear and desperation for his role in a terrible accident.

With great descriptions of Reno (a place I've never been) and the surrounding areas, ""Motel Life"" is a character piece first.  What it lacks in plot it makes up for in enjoyable dialogue and great, well-rounded characters.",1,1,0.9594128815777312
"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well.

"For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!",1,1,0.9490562521960841

Best pocket radio I've owned so far. My only complaint is the very non linear volume control. I like to listen at a quiet volume often but the first 1 or 2 tenths of the turn of the control and there is no sound whatsoever then during the third tenth of rotation the volume goes from nothing to way to loud for most of my listening preference. Otherwise a very good radio with incredible battery life. I've done several overnight listen's with the same set of batteries (at a low volume).,1,1,0.9475223221844269

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the rail.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and will cause the rail to slide around a bit if you use it on a bipod.

"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",1,1,0.9872661227768597

The Garmin Connect app is buggy and has been since CNET wrote it's review in 2015.  You'd think they fix it, but they haven't.  I've had to uninstall and reinstall the application on my phone twice this week and power off and power on the the phone once this week because the ""transfer failed"" message appears on the Garmin Vivoactive at the conclusion of the transfer.  In addition, there was another time where my steps would update on the application, but when I closed the application and reopened it they were lost repeatedly.

"This is a perfect example of CGI taking over.  It's obvious someone drew up a storyboard with a dozen action scenes and another dozen tense lines.  There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  This Lex Luthor is the weakest villain of all time...just incredibly bland and flat.  The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.  That's unforgiveable considering how many actors have now played Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent.  If either of them show up in some other form or fashion I would beg Hollywood to stop any and all references to their past.  It's becoming a xerox of a xerox.",1,1,0.9807750523287025

"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

"For background, by trade I'm a professional mechanic, so I'm able to follow directions fairly easily.  This had myself and my father scratching our heads quite a bit.  The directions clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole.  Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minutes of brain storming trying to interpret the directions.  They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step.  For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those parts go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) goes on left side.""  Seriously.

Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture looks and how the description cleverly talks about it being shatter proof.  It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond as a plastic backboard does when a ball hits it.  Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

"UPDATE#2 The tape that is used is not what I'm used to calling VHB. Dropped my hard hat last night and two holders popped off. Do not recommend.  UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where.

"Sometimes you read a book that you just devour. You inhale it. It consumes you. This is what The Perfect Life did to me.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise.",1,1,0.9659985709690267

Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it!

We saw them both in previous books and we knew that Magdalena had returned home with her teenage daughter after being gone since she became pregnant as a teenager. She has been the topic of small town gossip because she has never revealed the name of her daughter's father. Jake is a famous country singer who is taking a break because he's lost his muse and is unable to write any new music. Although famous, Jake is down to earth and likable. Im not always a fan of love at first sight, but Jakes feelings for Magdalena are sincere and based upon not only her looks but her singing. This was a good book and a nice addition to the series.

The rug was wrapped extremely well in layers of thick plastic and the ends capped with thick cardboard.

It just smelled like new carpet. Maybe some people have sensitive sniffers?

We also purchased a mat to go under the rug and it definitely added some extra cushion. We have hardwood floors but the rug doesn't slide at all. It's been tested too, our son runs around from kitchen to dining room to living room and the rug doesn't budge.

"There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

"...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.",1,1,0.9919488527329896

"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today.",1,1,0.9950646146224429

It works exactly the same, and also feels like a high quality clipper (way better than the cheap Wahl human/home clippers I have). It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4). If you want to use combs with this one, you'll pay more for something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Stainless-Steel-Guide-Combs-3390-100/dp/B002RBWL1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wahl Professional Animal Stainless Steel Guide Combs #3390-100</a>, which I'm sure is nice... but it's not included.

Also, note that there are two difference blade sizes for Wahl clippers. The ones designed for animal usage have longer combs which do not fit the cheaper (and not awesome) home Wahl clippers that many people may have. The animal ones are interchangeable with Andis (I used my Andis combs on this one for testing).

"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is.

"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

"When I first saw Twilight in 1998 I knew I was watching a valuable classic. We need a few more like Twilight these days to add intelligence that recent movies with action and adventure lack.  We need less high-tech-special-affects and more intriguing dialogue which includes humor, wit and wisdom that Twilight provides in abundance.
Listing the cast only was enough for me to go see the film : Paul Newman,
Gene Hackman, Susan Sarandon, James Garner, Stockard Channing, and with a
supporting cast of not-so-well-known actors who add to Twilight's appeal.
Among them (is/was) the late John Spencer, best known as the president's
secretary or chief aid in the TV series West End. Also, Reese Witherspoon
got an opportunity in this film playing the prodigal daughter of
Hackman/Sarandon. There are a few others who play character parts too.
I like the sophisticated decadence of Hollywood which Twilight so cleverly portrays with its sex, money, murder and cover-ups that are unearthed by Paul Newman, playing an aging ex-cop turned private-eye  which implicate friends and foes alike.
Here is a movie about old friendships, soon to be lost lives, and lost
illusions about life and love, that, in my opinion, make Twilight a modern classic for some soon-to-be ""late"" actors we have learned to love so much over the past fifty years.",1,1,0.9824984614655212

"Like many of us Id spent way too much time in the quest for the perfect stud finder  I own several properties and work on them myself.  A couple from the 50s have skim coat covered dry wall  which no stud finder I tried would reliably find a stud on  it was little better than a flip of a coin, even the most expensive fancy-pants electronic versions out there.  Regular dry wall, dandy  you're getting solid lights every time.  Through tile, mud-bed installs, skim coat over  dry wall: not a chance.  This bad boy works.  For realz bro.  I used it to install two bathroom fans this last weekend and it was perfect.  With the skim coat its not strong enough to stick to a wall or ceiling but the stick stands up and gives you a high-five when it crosses a nail or screw.  Yes, it can take a minute of systematic swiping to find the first one and then move up and down to verify (in the ceiling it helps to know which way the joist travel).  Super happy with this.

"(Wife): Basic Paw Patroller. You must attach stickers yourself. There are also 1-2 other things you must attach / get in place before letting a kid play with this one. So, I unpackaged the thing and prepped it before giving it to our daughter for Christmas. Comes with Ryder figure and ATV. The ATV is pretty sturdy and good on carpet. But, Ryder's legs are rather fragile. The Patroller trailer section only holds THREE (3) medium-sized vehicles while closed. BUT, you CAN stuff an entire set of Paw Patrol figurines inside the Paw Patroller when closed IF you use figurines, racers and/or an appropriate combination of figurines and mid-sized vehicles. The cab of the truck holds 4-5 figurines. (Five if you really pack 'em in, possibly plus 1-2 removable packs. )

Here's what we stuff in our Patroller (while still being able to close it):

Two medium-sized vehicles with riding figures (Ryder & ATV, and Everest & snowmobile);
Two small racers (Chase and Zuma);
Two figurines plus their detachable packs (Skye and Rocky);
Two figurines with spring-action packs (Robodog and Tracker); and
Two figurines with other features (Rubble and Marshall). Reasonably sturdy Paw Patroller. Makes noise. Comes with battery. Rather large. Opens to reveal a second floor.

It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too.

 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.

"I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).

"Although this movie has a far bigger ambition than budget, it still manageed to delight and entertain me throughout all of its 89 minutes.  It's by far the best movie THE ASYLUM has produced yet and while it certainly isn't up to the production standards of big budget hollywood stuff, it is often far more entertaining than the overblown hype Michael Bay and his ilk come up with.  Honestly, the movie has a very striking, almost psychodelic look with loads of wild, garish lighting and lurid color schemes.  The editing is fast and frantic and the visual effects are occasionally almost passable.  The acting is over the top (and lots of fun) and the script is really out there.

The super aggressive Dolby 5.1 surround sound will also give your subwoofer a real workout (although dialog is sometimes a bit distorted).

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.

"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.
They stay put
They are light
I like them and I will be using them for all of my future runs and gym workouts.

"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",1,1,0.991383898420868
"Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

Now that the price has gone up  I should've went for a long swim that night.",1,1,0.9743685333967763

"I was walking through the halls of the public library in Cleveland and I found a shelf with all these Roald Dahl books! And then I spotted ""Matilda."" I've been looking for ""Matilda"" because my mom had read it and she loved it! My mom is a good judge of books so I wanted to read it.

So I checked out the book and ran to the car so I could go to my grandma's house and read it. I had a bursting feeling in side of me. I felt ready to explode! When the car pulled into the driveway and parked, I burst out of the car and ran inside my grandma's house, flopped down on my favorite chair and started reading ""Matilda.""

The character Matilda is a genius girl with idiot parents who are always yelling and raging at her for no reason! With Matilda's magic powers she pays back her parents and has a fun time driving them crazy.

But things at school are different. The hated headmistress the Trunchbull is no match for Matilda and her magic powers. Miss Honey has a loving heart and trusts Matilda with her biggest secret.

This book is extremely funny and mysterious. After I finished this genius book, and my mom knew I loved it, she got me the movie! The movie is good, but not nearly as good as the book. You should see the movie and read the book! They're both wonderful.  -by Eliza (a student in msdu's class)",1,1,0.9076961743763556

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

Between the bad product and bad attitude, this company deserves to go broke.",1,1,0.9830619132269416

I use it on a Sheppach wet/dry grinder (I refuse to pay $500 for the Tormek). It fit the Sheppach just fine, and the lock grips very strong.

Right after I got it set, I picked up a large slab of Corian that was leaning against the grinder bench and whacked the toolrest with the Corian.

It's simply not durable enough for those littler ones as the stickers are vinyl and the backgrounds are a thicker cardstock; however, we have had no issues with my 2.5-year-old ripping the backgrounds or having trouble with the stickers. Its proving to be a great learning activity as every time she pulls off a sticker she tells me what it is or asks if she didn't know. It helps them associate what animals belong to which habitat in addition to learning what the habitats themselves are. Our stickers have stuck great though you have to be kind of careful when taking them off and moving them to a new spot as they get bent from finger nails fairly easily.

"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them.

"I thought that this would be more of a baseball book, as I'm a big fan of the nation's pastime. However, Babe Ruth figures into the story only tangentially as a means of helping to set the stage--Boston, as WWI is drawing to a close, and Prohibition is on its way. This book is a nice blend of fact and fiction, and the facts are more engrossing than the fiction. Boston at that time was a city in trouble, anxious to blame just about everything on the Communists, except perhaps the flu epidemic, and by the end I felt as if that had happened a couple of books ago. The family histrionics are fairly predictable, with the bad son (Connor), the good son (Danny, our hero), and the young son (Joe). Of course, Mom and Dad have their heads in the sand and think that the good son is really the bad son and vice versa. There's also Eddie, who came over on the boat from Ireland with Dad and is evil personified. Dad and Eddie are cops on the take, and Danny, also a cop, gets involved with unionizing the police force. And there's Luther Laurence, a black man on the run from the law. Even with all these cops around, only Eddie knows of Luther's past, and it is information that he uses for his own vile purposes.",1,1,0.8988673924540708

"The cover art of headless viewers watching television says it all. My only brush with the late Neil Postman came when he spoke at the university I was attending in the northwest. A breezy east coaster, he was unaware of the need to step on eggs. During the questions, one woman said, ""Mr. Postman, how can we help children have self-esteem?"" to which he replied, ""I don't want them to have self-esteem; I want them to esteem something other than themselves.""

After the stunned silence I and a few others rose and started clapping; it was very much as if life had been returned to Pepperland in Yellow Submarine. I've been clapping inwardly ever since, as when I read this book.

There are hundreds of reviews of this book, which created a stir everywhere. Everyone (except the people running TV) seems to have read it. Most readers find it smooth going. However, those who don't want to tackle the book can still wrestle with the ideas. In Postman's essay collection, Conscientious Objections, he replies to the question ""Why are books so long?"" with the answer that they don't have to be, and as an example gives a short version of this book.

The basic thesis is that along with George Orwell's 1984 in which civilization lapses into a dystopia (opposite of a utopia) ruled by oppression and violence, there was the opposite vision in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that society would be destroyed by indulgence in pleasure. Postman says that while you can make a good case for the first view, the second is in full swing. Now if only the desperate networks would read this book and (re)turn to making good TV.",1,1,0.9790422238586453

It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".

"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.

There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.

The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.

There is a real romance in there!  I did warm up towards Wulfgar. The characters did seem more believable and sympathetic towards the middle of the story. Towards the late middle to the end I could not put it down.",1,1,0.8773154968054165

"What little girl doesnt love it. The pieces are just too small.My son loves this!Great product. Great price! I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is by far my favorite. It is a great set. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she loves it! She is a little rough with it but she has had no problems with it. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too hard for her to put together. She is 5 1/2 and still loves it. The pieces are sturdy and are easy to put together. They do not come apart easily, but I did have to break a few pieces. It is a great learning tool for girls.If you are looking for a little more fun for your kid, this is a good buy.  My daughter was very excited to get this for her birthday and she plays with it all the time.  We have played with it at least once a week for about a week.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't seem to be a very durable toy.  But I can't say that it isn't.  I was worried that it might break, but it did not.  I think it will last for a long time.  I think it will last for years.  We will probably be purchasing a bigger version of this one.  It is great for coloring, but I would not recommend it for children under 4 years old.We love this toy!

"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product.",1,1,0.9493518668953494

"Not even sure I should really give this 3 stars. It had absolutely no effect on my cat. I can't say it was ""bad"" so I gave it the 3 just as a point of neutrality, which is to say nothing happened. Cats are funny though- maybe it's just my cat. I tried it, but she didn't even raise her nose or twitch a whisker. It certainly didn't entice her into her box. I suspect she had other issues for a while (it may be an age thing) that has made her box habits slip. Mostly now she's using it again (without using this product) - although she tends to favor one corner so much it's a bit of a problem, and sometimes over-shoots or just stops on the edge and wees outside of the box. We clean it regularly, at least once a day as a rule so whatever! I had hoped this might get her to be more drawn into the box and use it more evenly and more reliably but again- no effect whatsoever. $9 wasted.

"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.",1,1,0.989119152258888
"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself.",1,1,0.8047192025441529

"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the
stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders...",1,1,0.9743029846791166
"This is the first Nicholas Spark novel I have read.  I've seen the movie version of ""The Notebook"" (one of my favorite movies) and ""Nights in Rodanthe"", which I enjoyed.  I saw this book selling for fifty cents at a used book store and figured I'd give it a try, as usually the book is better than the movie.

I was surprised at how quickly I read through this book. I haven't read a fiction book in a long time and found myself inspired to pick it up two nights in a row.  I probably finished it in about 4 or 5 hours.

Even though it wasn't all that deep, I really enjoyed it. And though I knew the ending before I even picked up the book, tears flowed freely at the end (I did however, like the ending of the movie better.  The scene where she sits waiting for him after cooking an amazing meal was so sad and I was really surprised at the ending.)

"My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.",1,1,0.8588501377030902

"Chuck Palahniuk is most known as the author of Fight Club, the book that became the movie with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; and overnight Palahniuk had a cult following. Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.

This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.

From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores. This book will at times, turn your stomach, but will give you an understanding of the darkest side of human nature.

Readers beware! This book is like the fight club movie on super steroids.

"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund.",1,1,0.9361150196648991
"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you.",1,1,0.9862890440694584

A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;).",1,1,0.9788093020867747

"Naomi is half of a very successful mother and daughter singing group.  Her rise from poverty and struggles with raising two daughters on her own has been well documented.  Once the spotlight faded however she suffered from severe depression.  This book is hard to read but she is very honest about her disease. She writes about her struggle with her disease, the medical establishment and her difficult childhood.  It is obvious she wrote this book in hopes of helping others.  At the end of the book she does offer helpful advice.  I found the book very easy to read and hard to put down.  Whether you or someone you know is struggling with depression this book will inspire you.",1,1,0.9326213588919527
"Months ago, Farrah Langley and Xavier Kane engaged in a hot affair that last nearly a year. Upon a chance meeting in New York, the two run into one another and sparks still fly between Xavier and Farrah. As the two rekindle their relationship, Xavier realizes that the chemistry between them is more than just sex. Will Xavier be able to convince Farrah that they are perfect for one another?

Bachelor Unleashed is an enjoyable read. The sex scenes were scorching and incredibly vivid. The author took care to give incredibly descriptive scenes of New York that made me feel as if I were there with the two characters. However, it was odd that Ms. Jackson didn't devote the same amount of description to her main characters.

Bachelor Unleashed by Brenda Jackson is the second book I have read from this author. As this is a series, I would strongly urge the reader to read the first book, Bachelor Untamed. I greatly enjoyed the characters but felt left out as I didn't truly comprehend the significance of certain minor characters. Despite those minute misgivings, I thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry between the two main characters. I couldn't help but rooting for Xavier as he ruthlessly courted Farrah. I feel that Ms. Jackson writes wonderful characters and has a talent for writing brilliant settings that I must visit one day soon.  Being well satisfied by Ms. Jackson's writing, I look forward to reading another story by her in the future.

"Great lightweight way to protect your bare bladder while it's inside your pack all while keeping it insulated and thus the contents from freezing or becoming warm too quickly if filling it with cold water.

My only real (and negligible) gripe is that the hole cut at the bottom for the tube port at the didn't like up absolutely perfectly with my Camelbak Omega Water Beast 3L bladder, but it still works perfectly fine and I'm sure this is so it will fit a variety of bladders reasonably well rather than only my specific one perfectly.

I'm a coyote brown addict and thus got one in this color and their color is close enough. Color is kind of irrelevant when its insulating a bladder inside of a backpack though.

"The earbuds are of very good quality, producing very good sound even at high levels. They are comfortable in use. Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon).",1,1,0.9744952008626968
"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

The one caveat is that they are difficult to drive and a headphone amp takes care of that nicely.

"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact.

"As a recent new cat person, I purchased this for my cat to have a place to scratch, perch, and play. My cat was immediately interested in this condo, even as I was putting it together. Assembly wasn't too hard, I just followed what another reviewer had suggested and used a picture for reference. It should be noted that this unit is kind of HUGE. It is very tall! While the size works just fine for where I have it located, make sure to check the dimensions of your space before purchasing.

A few months after adopting my first cat, I adopted a second one. Both cats, each around 8 pounds, love to jump from the different perches. Though all the screws are tightened (something I check monthly as they tend to loosen over time), the whole thing does shake when they are running around on it. This does not seem to bother the cats, and therefore does not bother me. This unit has lived on hardwood floors and carpeting, neither flooring seems to aid or reduce in the amount of shaking. My cats do not spend much time in either cubby space, they mostly make use of the perches. While I love the blue color of this unit, it does highlight the amount of cat hair left behind. I vacuum the condo about once every 1-2 weeks.

I have had this unit for about 9 months and it has suffered a bit of damage. The highest perch is the most popular, and thus has suffered some minor shredding/tearing of the blue carpeting. The top hanging mouse has not survived, but the lower one is still hanging on. Finally, the base of the unit suffered some damage from my robot vacuum. I now block off the condo so that he cannot climb up it anymore (obviously not the cat trees fault).

Overall I think this is a great cat condo, and every time I see my cats playing on it, I feel happy.",1,1,0.9898110968344932

"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container. Because of the size of mine (about 1 foot and a half each), I go thru about a container in a little over a month. Regardless, these algae wafers seem to make them happy.

The movie is a bit slow and the plot was rather confusing. The film is mostly a story about a young man who has become a heroin addict and goes to rehab. He starts to live in a motel and meets a guy named John (Martin Sheen) who tells him that he's addicted to heroin. The guy tells John he's a drug addict. When John is in rehab, he makes a decision to quit. He tells John that he's going to be a heroin addict and that he's going to be spending the rest of his life in a motel.

"I purchased this doll for my 2 year old daughter to help her transition into being a big sister.  I plan on wearing it in a sling occasionally and making a little sling for her as well so she can carry it.  It's a great size for her.  While the mouth isn't really open for feeding, the lips are parted enough that she can sort of pretend to bottle feed it.  It's not super soft plastic and so the legs and arms are pretty stiff and solid.  The eyes remain open, which is kind of a bummer.  My daughter is not big into dolls, so I just try to mention it now and then and get her to rock it or feed it.

I'm really not a fan of the smell.  I think it's too strong.  I like that they used phalate-free plastic, but I'm still not sure I want it sharing my daughter's bath because of all the fragrance they use.  It's a weird vanilla smell. I did my research though and pretty much all these types of newborn dolls have this baked-in smell (the nice ones that is).  I'm sure you can get one from a toy store that is cheap and scentless, but I really wanted the safer plastic (not that any plastic is that great).

Miniland has a website and they have several more dolls of different sizes.  They have different ethnicities, which is great because I can get different ones as my daughter gets older- if she ends up liking dolls.  They are very well made and a nice quality.

"Nick Cartwright meets his mate when his best friend finds his after moving to a small town. His best friend Seth found Kasey (see book 1 in the True Mates series) and Kacey's brother Thayne, turns out to be Nick's mate. Only Thayne does not want a mate.

Nick is hurt to be rejected by his mate, especially after such a wonderful encounter with him. He decides to leave and honor his wishes even though it nearly kills him to do so. All he has ever wanted was to find someone to love and be loved by.

Thayne had learned at a young age that having a mate can be a devastating experience if something happens to them. He and a friend make a pact that they will never have a mate - so this will never be pain they will suffer from. Now that he has found his mate, he is wondering if he should re-think this decision. If he changed his mind, could he handle the pain if loss came?

Nick is already feeling the loss of his mate, since he was rejected by his. Then a problem arises and Nick mating with Thayne is the only solution that can be seen. Can Nick do something so selfless knowing he is not loved or wanted?

This story was just amazing! I found the characters development to be honest and real. Nick is devastated, and Thayne is moved by what he has done. I was literally caught up int he story and could not put it down!",1,1,0.9797348635133253

"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began.",1,1,0.9893803773067483

"I enjoyed the book enough to finish it. I have to say though that I thought the mystery wasn't a mystery to me at all. I won't ruin the surprise just that I figured it out long before it came out in the story. I do love the way Lee Childs writes his stories and the Jack Reacher character.

The only parts of the book I detested or thought it added little value to the book was the mother parts. I thought it got in the way of an interesting read. He also talks to his brother in this book but it doesnt add up to much. It was overly long and drawn out..it seems like half the book is about the mom. My only thought on this book is that could have been a lot shorter. The book really dragged on for me. Most of the Jack Reacher novels feature fist fights, guns and a mystery. Good stuff. This one sadly has the focus on the mother. Their are some fights and some gun play but most of it is just emotions. I also felt like the very last end was kind of cop out. I mean people could put 2 and 2 together and get 4 mighty easy and our hero does life in prison. My opinion only. Still I had fun reading it.",1,1,0.9603025658232418

"I read this book at the recommendation of my mom who LOVED it. But, when I told a good friend I was reading it, her response was, ""I HATED it."" How to reconcile the two reactions.

I'm not sure if I loved it, but I definitely didn't hate it. The book is indeed, as some reviewers pointed out, plot driven. The reader is constantly wondering what will happen next. Will our main character die of a fever or step on a poisonous snake?

But I disagree with some reviewers who feel the characters were not well drawn. In fact, my mom and I talked about the book and speculated about what would happen next. We are sure a sequel is possible. That tells me that we liked the characters enough to see them again.

What was so remarkable about this story was the place. Set in the heart of Brazil and then deep in the Amazon jungle, the book gives a vivid and beautifully written description of place. Readers never feel as if the author has taken us away from the perils that lie everywhere. It makes me not want to visit that part of the world!

The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars was the inability to believe certain things. I found myself coming out of the story (not good for a reader) and thinking, ""no way!"" First of all, would a pharma company invest that much time and money on a project and get no status reports, not a one? I doubt it. Would investors in that company allow it to do so? Perhaps for a short while but not for years. Secondly, what the strange and elusive Dr. Swenson was investigating seemed way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. I can't say what that was in order not to give anything away.

"Let us, gentle reader, ignore this films failure as a sci-fi / religious movie and let us celebrate its triumph as the greatest comedy of all time.

We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch. Militia members would know that so Child comes off sounding like a neophyte.",1,1,0.9837689600129216

"I enjoyed this book.  The author has a strong voice, but the book was much less overtly personalized than the editorial reviews led me to expect, for which I was grateful. In all other respects, I thought the editorial reviews are pretty good summaries of what you will find in this book.

It could have been better edited.  Despite its chronological organization, there are a surprising number of places where a person or event who has died earlier in the book pops up again. For instance, after the chapter on  Mussolini is over, with Mussolini quite dead, one moves to a chapter that begins with the Allied invasion in WWII with Mussolini quite alive again.  Just some light editing would have smoothed this out very easily.  The index is, in the same vein, sparse and poor and omits references too often.

Last, the text emphasizes the visual aspect of Rome, as one would expect from an art critic.  But there are only two sets of photos, perhaps 30 or so altogether, a mere fraction of the images and sights described by the author.  I often wanted to be able to compare his descriptions to photographs of what he is describing but it is only rarely possible within the covers of the book. I don't know if the ebook is different but the experience of reading would really be enhanced if there were more photos located closely to what is being described or at least hyperlinks to an image on the web with what is being described.

I would give the text, standing alone, 5 stars but the overall work, for the reasons just stated, I grade at 4 stars.",1,1,0.9774784487236222
"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third person, sometimes I found it a little confusing. Okay, I admit it, I'm not a young man anymore and maybe my short term memory isn't what it used to be.....  :) Erickson began each chapter with the name of the character telling it, so I guess the confusion wasn't the author's fault.

Anyway, I often like romance stories where opposites are attracted to each other. Jay and Quinn are very different but alike in many ways too. The plot contains a fair share of tension but I likes how the guys dealt with it.

Out of Frame was proofed well, and the Kindle formatting was very good on my iPad. This book is definitely on my 'recommend' list for those who like this genre!",1,1,0.9258783948909298

"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...

While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.

These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.

If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.

"Works well with most Z-Wave home automation systems; I'm using this with Vera. The lock itself is solidly constructed and can hold up to a lot of use.

"This keyboard is pretty great.  It takes a while to get used to... I have an iMac at home and a IBM Thinkpad at work.  I prefer Thinkpad keys, but are getting used to the new Apple keyboard without any problem.  No difference really with the extended wired keyboard that comes with the new imac in terms of feel.

The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).

Love this set!  It was for my grandson and he is crazy about it. He is 4 years old and begged me ( the sucker grandma Mum) to buy it for him.

"Books about successful technology companies are usually written by the entrepreneurs who founded the companies. It is truly remarkable for a book about a company which has grown from nothing to one of the largest computer companies in the world, written by an employee with a HR background and another employee with a diversity background. However, that is what we find with this book by Gina Qiao and Yolanda Conyers, suggesting that the key features of the company are at least as much tied up in its attitude towards employees and diversity as they are in the actual products the company sells.

The book describes a company which began with a group of Chinese scientists who had no commercial experience. Starting by renting out their expertise, then becoming distributors for international computer brands, then creating a Chinese-language motherboard, Legend Computers gradually grew to a position of dominance in the Chinese market before changing its English name to Lenovo and turning its ambitions towards a global market.

Many international companies have suffered culture shocks trying to take over Chinese companies; this book described the culture shocks Lenovo faced digesting the acquisition of the IBM personal computers business. A typical multinational company has a headquarters and dominant culture in one country; Lenovo has chosen not to pursue that route. It has adopted English as its language of businesses, requiring a significant sacrifice on the part of its founders and original staff. In different parts of the world, local culture prevails, rather than a monolithic head-office-imposed culture.

This book describes one way in which a truly international company can succeed, but it requires a lot of trust-building and willingness to sacrifice ones own interests. According to the authors:

We don't just say nice words about cultural diversity; we live it. That is the Lenovo Way.",1,1,0.96718639084875

"Following in the footsteps of the first book in the series, Marine for Hire, this delightful story treats us to Mac and Kelli. Mac is a security expert, ex-military, who needs a fiancee quickly as cover in his negotiations for an arms deal that is about to go down. Kelli is his sister's best friend, someone he vaguely remembers as a cute pig-tailed girl, but who will do in a pinch. Imagine his surprise when this vivacious gorgeous woman (who unbeknownst to him has had a crush on him for years) shows up for duty. The question is whether Mac will let the temporary arrangement they have turn into something more. I loved this story! Kelli is such a fun character - feisty, flirty, full of life. She has loved Mac from afar for so long, and now has the perfect opportunity to seduce him into bed and hopefully ingrain herself a little bit into his heart. Mac is also wonderfully written as a strong, handsome confident man, stoic on the outside but holding in strong passions on the inside. He feels that it's his duty to protect those around him and getting involved with a woman is too distracting. But Kelli is such a delicious distraction that he is willing to let down his guard just a little - long enough for her to get into his bed, and maybe a little corner of his heart as well. The sexual attraction between them sizzles and the love scenes are steamy and well written. Along with the relationship plot however is some suspense and action as well as Mac's job takes them into dangerous territory. In addition moments of humour abound, making the reader laugh out loud many times at the crazy antics that ensue. Secondary characters play important roles in the plot as well, mostly Mac's family as the relationship between Mac and Kelli develops. This was a fun, steamy, heartwarming read with laughs, tears and all emotions in between.",1,1,0.945315457826089

"My title really says it all. This edition was assigned because it was the around which the template for my course was written, and my school didn't care to rewrite the template based on the newer, more relevant edition. This was pure laziness on their part.

This edition mentions nothing newer than 2009, which, in the world advertising, is definitely ancient history. However, it's most unbearable trait was that it is wordy; the text could be cut by two thirds and not lose any valuable content. It spends a lot of time going over the same topics that it did in previous chapters. For a marketing text, you'd think the authors and publishers would have done a better job of taking their own skills to task and put forth a book that is more credible, engaging, and likable. It was all I could do just to keep my eyes open while reading it.

Tip to those reading it now: you only need to read the first one to two sentences of each paragraph to get the pertinent information. The rest of it is just filler.",1,1,0.9689603760837268

"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.",1,1,0.9768184573766029

"I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that.",1,1,0.9584635510219345

"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.",1,1,0.9828346014811649

"The Turning Point isn't as lightweight as it appears. Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other. Watching Mikhail leap through the air is indeed a pleasure as well; but I personally enjoy his love scenes and Leslie Brown's long arms reaching to the sky as she falls in love with him.  It's a wonderful movie. See it, buy it, love it for what it is.",1,1,0.9806161842385888

"If your desire is to use an electric drill, you may need to make a small hole in the bottom of the drill to get a solid surface to hold the drill in place. This is common in small drill bits.

I used a drill press with an adapter and a lot of pressure to hold the drill in place. I did not use the standard drill press so I could not test the impact. I tried to push the drill on the impact with a flat surface so that the impact would not get in the way. The impact does not move and it does not feel like a drill press.

"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

"A SANDY'S SEASHELL SHOP CHRISTMAS is a novella about a young widow named Tiff Riley and her three and a half year old son, Micah, who spend Christmas on the Outer Banks. Tiff had lost her husband, Aaron, to the war in Afghanistan. She hadn't even had much of a chance to be with him for very long before he was taken away from her. The tragedy of losing her husband and Micah's father at Christmas during the war in Afghanistan was heart-wrenching. She was struggling so badly trying to get through each day. Tiff's grief and disinclination to the prior three Christmases left her feeling empty. Just to be able to make it she ran to the one place she knew her husband loved the best, the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Sandy's sensitivity and perseverance as she drew Tiff and Micah into her Seashell Shop's Christmas party and the impact of the festivities on this family was inspiring.

The only tool that eats through them quickly is my circular saw- the drills can drill hundreds of holes or drive hundreds of screws before needing changed.

"I used to be stuck on Kershaw and CRKT for folding knives, but once I started looking for ""larger"" folding knives - I had to turn elsewhere.

Enter Cold Steel. The Voyager is a GREAT heavy duty folder. I'll make this simple and quick - you get all the blade quality and blade size with NONE of the weight and the ridiculously large handles that some companies put out.

The Large Voyager gives you a solid 4"" blade of nicely crafted AUS-8 stainless steel. I used to hate knives with the lock on the back of the handles. Cold Steel has changed that. I now LOVE them, those tri-ad locks are the best! Tougher than old leather, but not impossible to manipulate. I can open and close my Voyager easily with one hand, but I'm not supremely confident when I have the blade locked into position and ready for a tough task. As much as I like my other folders, even the ones with good liner locks....I can't say the same of them for some tasks.

Another note on the handles - they have good texture. It's aggressive, but not bitingly so. Are they thin? Yes, but they're tough. They're also comfortable, having the right grooves in the right places, allowing you good purchase on the knife, regardless of your hand size, I'm thinking.

The Voyager, in whatever configuration you prefer, is the best large folding knife I've ever come across, and the price is quite reasonable. Buy one, you'll like it!",1,1,0.9542805474425764

"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.",1,1,0.9842009770922069

"The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them...

So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife.",1,1,0.994319038296338

"Jeanette MacDonald shines like a bright Northern star in this 1933 MGM classic also starring Ramon Novarro. Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously. I thought MacDonald and Novarro made lovely couple and the story is full of warmth.",1,1,0.9748450277302462

"This short little novel, which spawned two films, one with Robert Donat and the other with Peter O'Toole, was originally a story Hilton wrote in November of 1933 for the Christmas issue of the British Weekly. It found its way across the pond to the U.S. and the Atlantic Monthly and became a smash hit. It was repackaged as a novel and went on to great reviews and big sales. The story revolves around an 80-ish man, Charles Edward Chipping or Mr. Chips, nearing the end of his life and his recollections of his times, tribulations and triumphs at the Brookfield all boys prep school in England, from before the turn of the century to the 1930s. It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI. Sweet, charming, inoffensive and ultimately slight and forgettable. If you want something meatier and more substantive from Hilton, try ""Lost Horizon,"" a terrific tale of Shangri-La.

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

"""My secret, my obsession is worse than any of theirs. To contain it, I do the only thing I can. I lock myself up. And in doing so, keep myself, and everyone else, safe.""

This was an edgy book that explored the dark places we try to keep locked up inside of us, since they are not in compliance with societal norms or potentially are illegal. Who among us doesn't have these secrets? Of course, most of us don't go to the extreme of locking ourselves up for the safety and protection of others.

The book was a quick, but very gripping and entertaining read. The story is told from several points of view which makes for an interesting read as well. The pace moved along at a good clip, and then picks up as climax is nearing (no pun intended). Excellent suspense and many emotions are drawn out of the reader.

I was not familiar with the author prior to this book. I don't read in the genre she specializes in, erotica, but this book definitely falls more in the thriller genre, and I would read more of her books with this sort of a cross over. She is a talented writer.

I am not familiar with camming, but would expect that she got that pretty accurately. That aspect of the book was a nice twist. Not only does the main character have psychotic urges, and a dark past, but because she has locked herself up, she has become one of the country's premier web cammers to support herself. That combination makes for a very entertaining character who drew many different emotional responses from me.

"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).  It appears to have been a good decision for me.

I haven't yet had any problems with hard water so I haven't felt the need to move the unit to just the hot water pipe.

"My daughter loves Rainbow Dash and Play Doh, so I thought this would be a great toy for her, but I'm disappointed with it. In the box, you get the Rainbow Dash, a pair of dough scissors, and 6 very tiny cans of Play Doh in purple, pink, green, yellow, blue, and orange. I did like that the Rainbow Dash has molds built onto it, but they are very hard to get the dough out of, such is the case of the dough extruder on the top of Rainbow Dash's head.

The problem with the extruder is that you can't fit that much dough into the hole and when you push down, the door keeps popping open and when the ""hair"" comes out, it isn't in a continuous flow because you have to keep stopping to add more dough, so it ends up breaking off. Pretty much a bummer for my daughter and we rarely use it. I do really like the scissors and we use them even without the pony and can use the raised designs on them to make impressions in the dough. I also wish that the dough cans it came with were larger because once you mix the colors in the extruder for the hair, it eventually turns an ugly dark color from repeated use of the dough. Lastly, the wings keep falling off of the pony. The idea of the pony is cool, but the execution is quite flawed.",1,1,0.9093331937666543

"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is a Star Trek fan, and I'm not one of those people. But I am a Star Trek fan. The basic premise of the movie is that the crew of a space ship in the 21st century is infected by a virus that gives them the ability to control their own behavior. As they become infected, the crew become increasingly violent and insane. As the infected crew becomes more violent and insane, they become more violent and insane. The movie begins to get a little slow, but as it goes on, it becomes more realistic. The aliens seem to be having a blast, and it's kind of scary that they get on the ship and are able to control their behavior. It's a nice twist to the story. It's also a little hard to figure out who the good guys are. In the first movie, the bad guys were pretty bad. I guess this movie was trying to be a bit of a sci-fi horror movie, but it was a little too dark for me. I was hoping for a more more ""serious"" twist, but it just doesn't work.

"Up to now, the only things Bill O'Reilly have ever been good at are weak-minded thought manipulation and noise pollution, but now he has another box to tick off on his resume: he can write humor. Unintentional humor, that is. You see, the garbage that is ""The No-Spin Zone: Confrontations with the Powerful and Famous in America"" proves that even on the page, Bill O'Reilly shines through as a complete hypocrite, and a horrible, horrible writer. It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

You can see it in print as clearly as on his shows: this guy pulls words out of the mouths of the people he interviews; he bullies them with his stupid questions that are engineered to cater to his own views... And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone. People like him are the reason many people think of the USA a ""bratty teenager of a country"". If you are looking for a book that is ""Fair and balanced"", this is most definitely not it. And really, I am not overly into politics, but I know that by supporting this travesty of a man and his pushy attitude the United States of America is sending the world the wrong kind of message.",1,1,0.9913983783357728

He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

"My 18 month old grandson loves this toy as do his two older sisters. They all love music, singing and dancing, and this toy has given them hours of pleasure as they listen and sing along to some of their favorites like ""Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes."" Plus included in the box are the lyrics to the songs just in case, as an adult, you don't know them! You'll be singing ""If You're Happy and You Know it"" with embarrassing frequency as it tends to stay in your head just like when the song came out!

The kids are able to record their own songs as well as sing to the five included prerecorded ones. The mirror is fun for the baby to laugh and giggle at himself as he watches the girls dance around the room singing in the microphone.

A plus for parents or adults is that the toy is easy to put together! The four legs snap into the base and are held there with a screw. No complicated diagrams or instructions.

"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases.

One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house.

This is a very interesting and well presented account  although I found the battle scenes lacking in depth but I would suppose  that was not the authors main focus but more on the people involved. I  think it may have helped to have added a few maps of the fighting in Mexico  and the Valley as if you have no prior knowledge of these areas you really  do not appreciate the efforts involved in moving from one point to another.

"These Small Tortilla Bowls Makers are a Great Alternative to frying Tortillas by Baking them in the Oven. I use regular size corn tortillas and they look Terrific. I found many other uses from all kinds of small Tostadas, and many other Mexican Food Variations to Salads and even Desserts. My Favorite is making Individual Apple Pies with Pastry Dough, you don't even have to oil or spray the Tortilla Bowls, the butter in the Pie Dough takes care of that, I Bake Eight at a time, the two sets I ordered it, a little bit of work but is worth it!

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top.

"Wicked for You is another delicious Wicked Lovers novel by Shayla Black. Mystery Mullins, daughter of a famous Hollywood actor/director and Axel Dillon, her hero rescuer, are the focus of this book 10 in the Wicked Lovers series. The characters were well developed and grew along with the story. There were a couple surprises along the way that I wasn't expecting, which were great!

Axel is a large and extremely sexy man/Dom. His attitude toward what he is, is very serious. I was surprised to see that even he has insecurities. As serious as he is about being a Dom, his feelings for Mystery are so deep that he finds it a constant struggle to keep a scene going instead of just making love to her. What ever they're doing, it's done with plenty of steam rolling off the pages! Mystery strikes me as not having a great deal of common sense. Not exactly an airhead but close. Of course, that could be from being raised as a teenager with all the Hollywood glitz and glamour. As an adult, she's more grounded in the real world. Heath is the one I really feel bad for. Unrequited love is a horrible thing to have to deal with. Maybe we'll see him with his own story in the future.  The story had a natural flow along with some backstory to make you understand why things were happening the way they were. This was another great read from an author who NEVER disappoints!

"Please visit my blog for more reviews! :) [...]

Delirium was a delightful read! I had just finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and so Delirium was a great book to read while I was in that ""Dystopian"" book phase (which I still am).
Delirium is set in a Dystopian future where their society believes that love is a disease that people can be cured of at the age of 18. Lena has just a little over three months before she turns 18, but she falls in love. She meets a boy named Alex who woos her, they fall in love, and then it kind of has a twist at the end... one that makes you go... ""Wait! WHAT!?! WHY!?""

What I liked
I really liked Lauren Oliver's style of writing. The plot never seemed choppy, it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter which is always a plus. The plot is kind of original and I say ""kind of"" because it is a Dystopian novel and these kinds of novels always have something outlawed, or forbidden. The forbidden thing in this novel would be the feeling of love. This means that you are matched with some one who you don't love, and you will never love. They will be your roommate who sleeps in the same bed with you. When you have kids you will only be watching and taking care of them out of duty, not out of love.

What I didn't like
Nothing. I really, really liked this book.

The details re: Mac's illness were exceptional, as were the details of each character. I really appreciated the details re: the idiosyncrasies of the characters ie: Max eating a handful of almonds during a very stressful time.

I wish the game was more interactive.  The basic game is pretty simple, and that's what I like about it.  The pieces can be easily moved around, and you can also add a puzzle to a game to keep things interesting.  The pieces are a little challenging to get them all together, but I like the idea that they can be put together quickly and easily.

"This book is - in a word - emotional. It's beautiful and brutal, honest and raw. It's a coming of age story of self-discovery and learning what matters.

Dawn considers herself the outcast of her small beach community. She and her best friend Zeke since childhood, and the two are inseparable. They have an us against the world mentality, especially when it comes to the other kids their ages. Dawn is every teenage girl. She's trying to figure out who she is, who she wants to be, and what she wants out of life.

Shea moves in next door and immediately immerses herself into Dawn and Zekes world. She's different; free. A young girl with worldly knowledge beyond her years. But like a lot of free spirits, there's an underlying current running through them. Shea is an incredible character.

This book is hopeful and heartbreaking. I found myself more than one having to take a deep breath, clutching my e-reader to my chest, praying that what I thought was about to happen really wasn't going to. That's how well Lilliana wrote this story. You don't feel like you're reading a work of fiction, but rather that you're living it with them. Every scenario, every feeling, you are in. You feel right along with them. This isn't a lighthearted book, but that's not to say that there aren't lighthearted moments. And the supporting characters make the book very well rounded.

I can't say enough about this book. It will touch all of your emotions. You will think about Dawn and Shea long after you've read the last word.",1,1,0.9167918559561897

"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

"There is no good way to review this book without giving the plot away and all I can say is that this is a extremely complex book with lots of twists and turns. There where times I did go out to Google to research some of the mythology mentioned in the book to round out the reading for my self-need but it is not necessary for the reader to do that in order to enjoy this book.

The author creates a very interesting world involving mythology and a large variety of complex characters drawing the reader deep into her fantasy world. Readers will be curious with the plaything, Damon and his story while wondering who he really is. As the story unwinds who he is becomes clearer and you will have that ""AH HA"" moment and feel at peace with him and his story.

Meanwhile Elysia, another aspect of this story, continues to draw your attention in another direction worth investigating. Elysia is a great example of how a woman would handle life threatening situations when there is no choice but to live. Her believable character will draw the reader closer with the desire to see her succeed and get her hearts desires.

Secondary characters are numerous and the reader will be able to tell that their stories were written in previous books to this series but this will not be a problem to reading this book.

"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube.

"After a long long time I got to read something so fulfilling. Something that one can identify with instantly and it does not take much effort as well. The theme of Brother Vs. Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!
East of Eden was heavy for me!!
Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.
The Theme: Brother vs. Brother
The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on
him.
He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come.
The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say ""History"".
The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.
I guess the Biblical influence is immense in the book - but obvious it had to be!!
Overall, a great great awesome read!!",1,1,0.9656189563376473

"Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

"Author Paul Theroux spent several months traveling through the great Middle Kingdom (China) by train in 1986, as that nation's economic surge was underway and change was starting to affect the land.  He details what he found and observed, making a host of political and social observations.  He notes that this communist nation was rapidly becoming capitalist (but remaining a police state) under the market reforms of Deng XiaoPing, and the relief many ordinary Chinese felt that the Mao years and Cultural Revolution were gone.  He also looks at the rising prosperity, a factor that has surprised more than a few western visitors.  Yet reading this book after my own (much shorter) trip to China a decade later, I found his writing style rather stiff, and his adventure not all that adventurist  It does have some interesting if somewhat dated mid-1980's observations of China, a nation that has changed significantly over the past quarter century.",1,1,0.9889060498433122

"When I was a child, I devoured Isaac Asimov's books -- especially his Robot and Foundation books, which he ended up combining near the end of his life. As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies.",1,1,0.9923894352300837

"I've read so many forum streams about ""skirt or no skirt"", which toilet is the ""best"" and so on, it too me a few hours to digest all the feedback. However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun.

"I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR. All in all, this comes across as a cheap, uninspired knock-off of other fantasy classics and is not worth wasting one's money on. I would recommend passing on this one.",1,1,0.9435394195516578

The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

"This is exactly what I wanted.  I was looking for a bedspread that would be long enough to hide the metal bed rails--the bed has a headboard but no side rails or foot board.  I've been using a dust ruffle for years and, honestly, the tucking of all of the blankets, making sure the dust ruffle doesn't get caught up in the tucking, was very aggravating.  Especially since my toddler grandson naps in this bed at least twice a week.  I wanted a simpler way to make the bed after nap without having to tuck all of the blankets in.  The bed is queen size and after measuring, I determined that a queen size spread would not work--they are typically sized for use with dust ruffles or on beds with side rails and foot board.  I ordered a king size spread and turned it so the long edge runs across the width of the bed instead of the length of it.  Because there is no pattern that would dictate it be used the way it was intended, this works just great.  The spread is top quality.  After making sure it was the right fit, I washed it and put it on the bed.  It's just perfect and washed beautifully.  No odd smell, no excessive lint, no missed stitching.  This purchase also had the option of buying standard size pillow shams (king spread with standard OR king shams), which I did.  My toddler's bed looks great and will be easy to make as he gets in and out of it. I am going to check to see if it comes in other colors so I can order another one for change of seasons.

"This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand.

"When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry. I've gone through 5 Wayne pumps in 6 years, this will be the last.",1,1,0.9905710525325355

After his purchase is finished he sets off for home but then Talia realizes he didn't sign the order forms and must contact him, her Aunts push her to call and after that it settled on a meeting Cedar then calls back and invites her to his Grandmothers house for dinner and to witness the Full Moon ceremony with him.

These clamps worked extremely well and have kept the tools in good working order for a very long time. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8-4 4-inch saws that I had in the past. I have had several of these saws for years and have used them with great success. I had to replace one with a Schlage saw because I had a problem with the wire holding it in place. I ended up returning the saw to the manufacturer for replacement. The new saws are much better and the wire holding them in place is much more secure.,0,0,0.16066212440824695

"I bought this book with great expectation having read the glowing reviews here at amazon.  The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned.
On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past.
Stegner writes a convincing enough narrative about the grace of surviving life, but as for me, the next time I want a story about nothing, I will tune in to a Seinfeld rerun.",1,1,0.9786230593533501

"Headline:
Summerlong was a surprise hit for meits darker and edgier than the cover would lead you to believe.

Major Themes:
Marriage, mid-life crises, general discontent, maintaining your identity through motherhood

What I Loved:
- The very beginning of this one was just okay, but I liked it more and more the farther I read.
- You can really feel this bookthe simmering suburban discontent, everyone having an itch thats just waiting to be scratched, the restlessness that comes with sweltering summer days. Its like a sea of smoldering embers threatening to ignite at the slightest catalyst.
- The cast of characters is delightfully eclectic and everyone is dealing with their own issuesthe unhappily married housewife (Claire), the failing and desperate real estate agent (Don), the grieving lover (ABC), and the actor returning home to tie up loose ends (Charlie). And, best of all.
- Ruth Manetti (she deserves her own bullet)! This eighty-some year old pothead gives the best life adviceI decided she needs to be my shrink!

You see? Ruth says. This is why I like you more than anybody else. When I give you the straight dope, you don't reel off some optimistic bulls***.

- Bakopoulos nails the issue of women losing their identities during motherhood. I highlighted so many passages pertaining to this issue that made me think yes, thats exactly how it is. And, Im even more impressed given hes male!

What I Didnt Like:
The ending fizzled a bit and partially revolved around the storyline I was the least invested in. But, it didn't bother me that much because this book was about the journey and I enjoyed that immensely.

A Defining Quote:
Something happened to me, Claire says. I don't know what. I stopped wanting things. And now? he says. Now, she says, I just want.

Good for People Who Like:
Books set in the Midwest, books about marriage, books about motherhood, gorgeous writing, quirky characters, small town life

"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that takes place in 1871-1872.  She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'.  He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots.  In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.

 Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn.  He suggested that she find a more symbolic title.  When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion.  When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.

Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out.  Perkins prodded her to get going again.  This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.  Read THE YEARLING & also the excellent biography of Perkins by A. Scott Berg.",1,1,0.962892901860314

"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about Saba and her journey to recover her twin brother, Lugh, after he is kidnapped from their home at Silverlake.  Saba is very close with her twin brother and puts him on a pedestal...he is the light to her dark.  When the reader first encounters Lugh, he is a father-like figure, taking care of the day-to-day needs of Saba, their father, and their younger sister, Emmi.  Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.  Along the way, she also meets Jack and a gang of revolutionary girls called the Free Hawks.  We watch how she grows as a person and learns the importance of family and friends.

"I thought this was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was painful to watch this child being bullied by her drunken father. She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes. She runs for cover and fear, not just from the fire, but the wrath of her father...she hides in a cardboard box. The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking. This child seemed like a half wild animal running through the swamp, screaming and shouting, and the filth...I just wanted to bath her, dress her in clean clothes and show her there is something better.

"I've enjoyed this series, and believe we may have to face a TWO state solution ourselves in the VERY near future.  As pointed out throughout the 5 books, freedom loving people cannot coexist with nanny state leftist progressives.  Civil war in our modern age would be beyond intolerable, and both sides know we will never change the others mind.  This leaves us with one solution to our political problem: A Free State America and a Progressive Union America.  We as a people can then ""vote with our feet"" as to which side best represents our hopes and dreams.

The Bombay's are a family of assassins and have been for the past 4000 yrs or so. If you are a blood relative, then you will become an assassin or die. If you marry into the family, male or female, you must change your last name to Bombay.  The children are all named after countries, states, cities, etc. The cousins that we read about are fun and funny.  Despite being assassins, they live normal lives, just like the rest of us, except for the rather large trust funds that each has.  The assassin business has paid well over the years.

I didn't particularly like the first story, Our Song Cassie was a bit too whinny for me, but that was more personal preference than a reflection on the story. War of Hearts also felt a little contrived, but I am sure there are those that would disagree.
I did enjoy Between the Lines. The romance was so cute and I couldn't help but root for Thomas to work out his mix up. I also loved William and his concern for Claire in A Taste of Home.   Both these stories had swoon worthy endings left you rooting for happily ever afters.

"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around.",1,1,0.9493564284650691

"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.
Space age looking, and heavier than most standard claw hammers, but easy to use and swing with less shock than a wooden or straight plastic handled hammer.
Like others I have noticed some nicks and scratches after very little uses so suggest the steel is a little softer than it should be maybe.
At nearly $50 this hammer is almost 3 times more expensive than the Estwing steel shaft 16 oz claw hammer, over 2.5 times as much as the excellent Stanley 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme AntiVibe Rip Claw Nailing Hammer, and around six times more than a standard hickory handled or fibreglass Stanley.

"I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!",1,1,0.9743312915312995

"This is a beautifully-written book by a highly literate author who has a respect for the written word. No gimmicks, no hype, nothing that's cheap about the all-important subject of coming of age...how refreshing! Reading the chapter titles alone is stimulating, because you get a glimpse of the structure of the book without being told the exact details (which of course, entices you to want to see how the story plays outs).

The realism of the book draws the reader in effortlessly. The journey is epic and dramatic without being formulaic or repetitious. There are many poignant lines throughout the content too, which give the book added depth and insight. I think the following line (from one of the chapters in The Same Moon) describes the book very well: ""Life was no film set, and there was no script."" I particularly enjoyed Chapter Five: The Courtship for its unabashed view on ""the dating game.""

As someone who enjoys culture and travelling, this book was certainly a treat. The strength of books like these is that they remind discerning readers how literature is differentiated from the film medium. While the latter tends to be more impressive in terms of 'visuals', good literature is intimate because it engages the reader through a one-on-one experience.

"It almost hurts to write a two star review for this speaker.  It's beautifully crafted and sounds great.

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.  I have battery powered Bluetooth speakers that don't have this ""feature""; why Polk decided to include it in an AC powered speaker makes no sense.  Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

Also, I haven't been able to keep the Airplay connection working for more than a few minutes.  I suppose this could be due to any number of factors, so I can't put this squarely on Polk, but that was one of the primary reasons I selected this particular model.",1,1,0.9415898109261877

"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.

Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.

The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.

Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is.",1,1,0.9484053238200012

"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher.",1,1,0.8729862543379686

"I've owned many-a steam mops in my day, and while this is a great mop that heats up quickly and offers a bunch of nice features, I wouldn't pay the hundred and forty dollars they're asking for this. There are just too many other, cheaper models out there that get your floors just as clean.

Now, if you're someone who sees yourself using the detachable handheld all the time, then this may be the steam mop for you. I THOUGHT I would use it all the time, but in reality I only used it once...the first day I got it.

The machine is light and easy to use while you're actually using it, but if you need to set it down, it's prone to tipping over due to it's shape.  The tank seems to go through water faster than other mops I've used, but maybe that's just me. Or maybe the steam gets hotter than other mops I've used, so it goes through water quicker? I don't know, but I do know I have to fill the tank three times to get all the hardwood/tile/stone in my house done.

Overall, would I recommend this mop? Absolutely. I just don't think it's necessary for the amount of money it costs (unless you really want that detachable steamer). There are plenty of high-quality steam-mops out there for much cheaper.",1,1,0.9890432364105287

"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light.",1,1,0.9677301677064127
"I Compare this movie to inception because tht was the last sci-fi action movie I saw that was better than I was expecting (and I was expecting a lot). This is a solid adult sci-fi flick. The first act of the film is intriguing and shows a lot of promise. It plays out a little slower more in a drama fashion or the middle third of the film. And the third act is not as satisfying as it could have been.

As a reviewer on Rottentomatoes mentioned, this is like a mashup of other classic sci-fi films. Terminator, 12 Monkeys and Firestarter immediately spring to mind. It's a good movie, do not get me wrong, but I would go with low expectations and you might find that there are some interesting concepts at play (poor Seth).

Loved the way the film was shot. The audio mix is good and the editing is pretty great (Pulp Fiction style time structure). This will be a good Blu-Ray no doubt.",1,1,0.8817462855821803

This top is adorable! Very flattering and I love the black with white flowers. The only problem is when I bend over. It's a little too revealing in the chest area when I have to bend over to pick things up. I'll just have to wear something under it.,1,1,0.6444895613132322

This is a series that has an inherent quality to it that is not lost on the viewer. The story is told very well and the characters are very well developed.

"I bought two of these and both work fine. I will keep one for the other one. I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one. It works great, but it is not as bright as the old one. I have to use a larger diameter bulb, which is a lot better. It has more of a fluorescent look, but I like the look more. I like that the bulb is longer than the old one, which is nice. I use the same bulb twice a day, and use it daily. It is more of a ""screwdriver"" type of light. The reason I like this bulb is because it has a longer diameter, which makes it easier to carry around. Also, the light is pretty bright, so I'm happy with the light. I don't really like the color of the bulb, but it is pretty cool. I bought a couple of these for my son's bedroom. He loves it. He loves the way it lights up his room. I'm very happy with the size of this light.",0,0,0.01572592904082158
"I've had this one on my TBR list for a while and when it went on sale for 99 cents it was time to one click and read. The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.
